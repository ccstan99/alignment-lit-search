Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques. Our implementation has been made publicly available to facilitate further research on efficient architecture search algorithms."},{"id":"1906.02530v2","title":"Can You Trust Your Model's Uncertainty? Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty Under Dataset Shift","authors":"Yaniv Ovadia, Emily Fertig, Jie Ren, Zachary Nado, D Sculley, Sebastian Nowozin, Joshua V. Dillon, Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Jasper Snoek","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.02530v2","content":"Modern machine learning methods including deep learning have achieved great success in predictive accuracy for supervised learning tasks, but may still fall short in giving useful estimates of their predictive {\\em uncertainty}. Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods. However, some methods that marginalize over models give surprisingly strong results across a broad spectrum of tasks."},{"id":"1902.08265v1","title":"Quantifying Perceptual Distortion of Adversarial Examples","authors":"Matt Jordan, Naren Manoj, Surbhi Goel, Alexandros G. Dimakis","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1902.08265v1","content":"Recent work has shown that additive threat models, which only permit the addition of bounded noise to the pixels of an image, are insufficient for fully capturing the space of imperceivable adversarial examples. For example, small rotations and spatial transformations can fool classifiers, remain imperceivable to humans, but have large additive distance from the original images. In this work, we leverage quantitative perceptual metrics like LPIPS and SSIM to define a novel threat model for adversarial attacks.   To demonstrate the value of quantifying the perceptual distortion of adversarial examples, we present and employ a unifying framework fusing different attack styles. We first prove that our framework results in images that are unattainable by attack styles in isolation. We then perform adversarial training using attacks generated by our framework to demonstrate that networks are only robust to classes of adversarial perturbations they have been trained against, and combination attacks are stronger than any of their individual components. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our combined attacks retain the same perceptual distortion but induce far higher misclassification rates when compared against individual attacks."},{"id":"2006.13258v6","title":"Adversarial Soft Advantage Fitting: Imitation Learning without Policy Optimization","authors":"Paul Barde, Julien Roy, Wonseok Jeon, Joelle Pineau, Christopher Pal, Derek Nowrouzezahrai","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.13258v6","content":"Adversarial Imitation Learning alternates between learning a discriminator -- which tells apart expert's demonstrations from generated ones -- and a generator's policy to produce trajectories that can fool this discriminator. This alternated optimization is known to be delicate in practice since it compounds unstable adversarial training with brittle and sample-inefficient reinforcement learning. We propose to remove the burden of the policy optimization steps by leveraging a novel discriminator formulation. Specifically, our discriminator is explicitly conditioned on two policies: the one from the previous generator's iteration and a learnable policy. When optimized, this discriminator directly learns the optimal generator's policy. Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require an additional optimization loop. This formulation effectively cuts by half the implementation and computational burden of Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithms by removing the Reinforcement Learning phase altogether. We show on a variety of tasks that our simpler approach is competitive to prevalent Imitation Learning methods."},{"id":"2011.05623v3","title":"Fooling the primate brain with minimal, targeted image manipulation","authors":"Li Yuan, Will Xiao, Giorgia Dellaferrera, Gabriel Kreiman, Francis E.

ANNs are the best predictors of neural activity in the ventral stream; moreover, recent work has demonstrated that ANN models fitted to neuronal activity can guide the synthesis of images that drive pre-specified response patterns in small neuronal populations. Despite the success in predicting and steering firing activity, these results have not been connected with perceptual or behavioral changes. Here we propose an array of methods for creating minimal, targeted image perturbations that lead to changes in both neuronal activity and perception as reflected in behavior. We generated 'deceptive images' of human faces, monkey faces, and noise patterns so that they are perceived as a different, pre-specified target category, and measured both monkey neuronal responses and human behavior to these images. We found several effective methods for changing primate visual categorization that required much smaller image change compared to untargeted noise. Our work shares the same goal with adversarial attack, namely the manipulation of images with minimal, targeted noise that leads ANN models to misclassify the images. Our results represent a valuable step in quantifying and characterizing the differences in perturbation robustness of biological and artificial vision."},{"id":"2110.10819v1","title":"Shaking the foundations: delusions in sequence models for interaction and control","authors":"Pedro A.

The present work evaluates 32 attacks of 5 different types against models adversarially trained on a 100-class subset of ImageNet. Our empirical results suggest that evaluating on a wide range of perturbation sizes is necessary to understand whether adversarial robustness transfers between perturbation types. We further demonstrate that robustness against one perturbation type may not always imply and may sometimes hurt robustness against other perturbation types. In light of these results, we recommend evaluation of adversarial defenses take place on a diverse range of perturbation types and sizes."},{"id":"1806.00610v1","title":"Accounting for the Neglected Dimensions of AI Progress","authors":"Fernando Mart\u00ednez-Plumed, Shahar Avin, Miles Brundage, Allan Dafoe, Sean \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh, Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1806.00610v1","content":"We analyze and reframe AI progress.

The multidimensional performance and cost space can be collapsed to a single utility metric for a user with transitive and complete preferences. Even absent a single utility function, AI advances can be generically assessed by whether they expand the Pareto (optimal) surface. We explore a subset of these neglected dimensions using the two case studies of Alpha* and ALE.

Namely, these generative models have an unusual combination of predictable loss on a broad training distribution (as embodied in their \"scaling laws\"), and unpredictable specific capabilities, inputs, and outputs. We believe that the high-level predictability and appearance of useful capabilities drives rapid development of such models, while the unpredictable qualities make it difficult to anticipate the consequences of model deployment. We go through examples of how this combination can lead to socially harmful behavior with examples from the literature and real world observations, and we also perform two novel experiments to illustrate our point about harms from unpredictability.

We conclude with a list of possible interventions the AI community may take to increase the chance of these models having a beneficial impact.

The effort to automate such research, known as AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on sophisticated expert-designed layers as building blocks---or similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available.

Notably, people will tend to adopt an A.I. system if it confers them an advantage, at which point non-adopters might push for a strong regulation if that advantage for adopters is at a cost for them. Here we propose an agent-based game-theoretical model for these conflicts, where agents may decide to resort to A.I. to use and acquire additional information on the payoffs of a stochastic game, striving to bring insights from simulation to what has been, hitherto, a mostly philosophical discussion. We frame our results under the current discussion on ethical A.I. and the conflict between individual and societal gains: the societal value alignment problem. We test the arising equilibria in the adoption of A.I. technology under different norms followed by artificial agents, their ensuing benefits, and the emergent levels of wealth inequality. We show that without any regulation, purely selfish A.I. systems will have the strongest advantage, even when a utilitarian A.I. provides significant benefits for the individual and the society. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to develop A.I. systems following human conscious policies that, when introduced in society, lead to an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters are not at a cost for non-adopters, thus increasing the overall wealth of the population and lowering inequality.

In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training.

In image classification, we find that many neurons learn highly abstract but semantically coherent visual concepts, while other polysemantic neurons detect multiple unrelated features; in natural language inference (NLI), neurons learn shallow lexical heuristics from dataset biases. Second, we see whether compositional explanations give us insight into model performance: vision neurons that detect human-interpretable concepts are positively correlated with task performance, while NLI neurons that fire for shallow heuristics are negatively correlated with task performance.

Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we propose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an additional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network adversarially against the feature embedding network.

Recently, it was found that the maximization of MIAS can be used as an intrinsic motivation for artificial agents. In literature, the term empowerment is used to represent the maximum of MIAS at a certain state. While empowerment has been shown to solve a broad range of reinforcement learning problems, its calculation in arbitrary dynamics is a challenging problem because it relies on the estimation of mutual information. Existing approaches, which rely on sampling, are limited to low dimensional spaces, because high-confidence distribution-free lower bounds for mutual information require exponential number of samples. In this work, we develop a novel approach for the estimation of empowerment in unknown dynamics from visual observation only, without the need to sample for MIAS. The core idea is to represent the relation between action sequences and future states using a stochastic dynamic model in latent space with a specific form. This allows us to efficiently compute empowerment with the \"Water-Filling\" algorithm from information theory. We construct this embedding with deep neural networks trained on a sophisticated objective function. Our experimental results show that the designed embedding preserves information-theoretic properties of the original dynamics."},{"id":"1810.08700v2","title":"Safe Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty Estimates","authors":"Bj\u00f6rn L\u00fctjens, Michael Everett, Jonathan P.

However, DNNs tend to be overconfident in predictions on unseen data and can give unpredictable results for far-from-distribution test data. The importance of predictions that are robust to this distributional shift is evident for safety-critical applications, such as collision avoidance around pedestrians. Measures of model uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates. The methods are embedded in a Safe Reinforcement Learning framework to form uncertainty-aware navigation around pedestrians. The result is a collision avoidance policy that knows what it does not know and cautiously avoids pedestrians that exhibit unseen behavior. The policy is demonstrated in simulation to be more robust to novel observations and take safer actions than an uncertainty-unaware baseline."},{"id":"1911.00459v1","title":"Positive-Unlabeled Reward Learning","authors":"Danfei Xu, Misha Denil","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1911.00459v1","content":"Learning reward functions from data is a promising path towards achieving scalable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for robotics.

These reward delusions can lead to unintended and even dangerous behaviors. On the other hand, adversarial imitation learning frameworks tend to suffer the opposite problem, where the discriminator learns to trivially distinguish agent and expert behavior, resulting in reward models that produce low reward signal regardless of the input state. In this paper, we connect these two classes of reward learning methods to positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, and we show that by applying a large-scale PU learning algorithm to the reward learning problem, we can address both the reward under- and over-estimation problems simultaneously.

While broad ethical rules may seem straightforward to state (\"thou shalt not kill\"), applying such rules to real-world situations is far more complex. For example, while \"helping a friend\" is generally a good thing to do, \"helping a friend spread fake news\" is not. We identify four underlying challenges towards machine ethics and norms: (1) an understanding of moral precepts and social norms; (2) the ability to perceive real-world situations visually or by reading natural language descriptions; (3) commonsense reasoning to anticipate the outcome of alternative actions in different contexts; (4) most importantly, the ability to make ethical judgments given the interplay between competing values and their grounding in different contexts (e.g., the right to freedom of expression vs. preventing the spread of fake news).   Our paper begins to address these questions within the deep learning paradigm. Our prototype model, Delphi, demonstrates strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning, with up to 92.1% accuracy vetted by humans. This is in stark contrast to the zero-shot performance of GPT-3 of 52.3%, which suggests that massive scale alone does not endow pre-trained neural language models with human values. Thus, we present Commonsense Norm Bank, a moral textbook customized for machines, which compiles 1.7M examples of people's ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations.

When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors.

This paper empirically investigates the security guarantee of this technique, which is introduced as the problem of model completion: Given the entire training data set or an environment simulator, and a subset of the parameters of a trained deep learning model, how much training is required to recover the model's original performance? We define a metric for evaluating the hardness of the model completion problem and study it empirically in both supervised learning on ImageNet and reinforcement learning on Atari and DeepMind~Lab. Our experiments show that (1) the model completion problem is harder in reinforcement learning than in supervised learning because of the unavailability of the trained agent's trajectories, and (2) its hardness depends not primarily on the number of parameters of the missing part, but more so on their type and location.

This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference and dynamic task planning significantly improves both objective and perceived performance of the human-robot team. Participants were highly sensitive to the differences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot that adapted to their actions over one that did not."},{"id":"1803.06373v1","title":"Adversarial Logit Pairing","authors":"Harini Kannan, Alexey Kurakin, Ian Goodfellow","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.06373v1","content":"In this paper, we develop improved techniques for defending against adversarial examples at scale. First, we implement the state of the art version of adversarial training at unprecedented scale on ImageNet and investigate whether it remains effective in this setting - an important open scientific question (Athalye et al., 2018). Next, we introduce enhanced defenses using a technique we call logit pairing, a method that encourages logits for pairs of examples to be similar. When applied to clean examples and their adversarial counterparts, logit pairing improves accuracy on adversarial examples over vanilla adversarial training; we also find that logit pairing on clean examples only is competitive with adversarial training in terms of accuracy on two datasets. Finally, we show that adversarial logit pairing achieves the state of the art defense on ImageNet against PGD white box attacks, with an accuracy improvement from 1.5% to 27.9%. Adversarial logit pairing also successfully damages the current state of the art defense against black box attacks on ImageNet (Tramer et al., 2018), dropping its accuracy from 66.6% to 47.1%. With this new accuracy drop, adversarial logit pairing ties with Tramer et al.(2018) for the state of the art on black box attacks on ImageNet."},{"id":"2011.08512v1","title":"Preventing Repeated Real World AI Failures by Cataloging Incidents: The AI Incident Database","authors":"Sean McGregor","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2011.08512v1","content":"Mature industrial sectors (e.g., aviation) collect their real world failures in incident databases to inform safety improvements.

However, these methods do not scale to explaining entire datasets and cannot correct the problems they reveal. We introduce a method for efficiently explaining and regularizing differentiable models by examining and selectively penalizing their input gradients, which provide a normal to the decision boundary.

One such challenging application is bacteria identification based on genomic sequences, which holds the promise of early detection of diseases, but requires a model that can output low confidence predictions on OOD genomic sequences from new bacteria that were not present in the training data. We introduce a genomics dataset for OOD detection that allows other researchers to benchmark progress on this important problem. We investigate deep generative model based approaches for OOD detection and observe that the likelihood score is heavily affected by population level background statistics. We propose a likelihood ratio method for deep generative models which effectively corrects for these confounding background statistics. We benchmark the OOD detection performance of the proposed method against existing approaches on the genomics dataset and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, we argue that this data, which is uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer.

On smaller-scale datasets where competing approaches to certified $\\ell_2$ robustness are viable, smoothing delivers higher certified accuracies.

This approach is intended to provide value for a principal: the user on whose behalf the agent acts. The objectives given to these agents often refer to a partial specification of the principal's goals. We consider the cost of this incompleteness by analyzing a model of a principal and an agent in a resource constrained world where the $L$ attributes of the state correspond to different sources of utility for the principal. We assume that the reward function given to the agent only has support on $J < L$ attributes. The contributions of our paper are as follows: 1) we propose a novel model of an incomplete principal-agent problem from artificial intelligence; 2) we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which indefinitely optimizing for any incomplete proxy objective leads to arbitrarily low overall utility; and 3) we show how modifying the setup to allow reward functions that reference the full state or allowing the principal to update the proxy objective over time can lead to higher utility solutions.

We show that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and\/or training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We then differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have the beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data or training environment, making their potential impact large. This paper introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for neural architecture search (NAS), which is rate-limited by such evaluations, enabling massive speed-ups in NAS. GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art, finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the art approaches, which achieve top performance while using orders of magnitude less computation than typical NAS methods.

While recent empirical results demonstrate that ranked demonstrations allow for better-than-demonstrator performance, preferences over demonstrations may be difficult to obtain, and little is known theoretically about when such methods can be expected to successfully extrapolate beyond the performance of the demonstrator. To address these issues, we first contribute a sufficient condition for better-than-demonstrator imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over demonstrations can better reduce reward function ambiguity when performing inverse reinforcement learning. Building on this theory, we introduce Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral cloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked demonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly surpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the demonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision, such as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we show that preference-based inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in traditional imitation learning settings where only unlabeled demonstrations are available."},{"id":"1712.04307v3","title":"AI Safety and Reproducibility: Establishing Robust Foundations for the Neuropsychology of Human Values","authors":"Gopal P.

To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models.

Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient (PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while guaranteeing near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints.

This behavior is not captured by classical generalization, which would only consider the average error and not the distribution of errors over the input domain. Our formal conjectures, which are much more general than this example, characterize the form of distributional generalization that can be expected in terms of problem parameters: model architecture, training procedure, number of samples, and data distribution.

This setting is challenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific (superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals. To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial: they are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an image. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks' out-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient method that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM representation is not predictable. The second method is built on the independence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the subspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's.

A market is then called a logical inductor if (very roughly) there is no polynomial-time computable trading strategy with finite risk tolerance that earns unbounded profits in that market over time.

Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the meta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with different widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on data with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image datasets to a text task."},{"id":"1805.07914v3","title":"Imitating Latent Policies from Observation","authors":"Ashley D.

We test two model selection criteria, cross-validation and minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and hyperparameters in the true few-shot setting. On average, both marginally outperform random selection and greatly underperform selection based on held-out examples. Moreover, selection criteria often prefer models that perform significantly worse than randomly-selected ones. We find similar results even when taking into account our uncertainty in a model's true performance during selection, as well as when varying the amount of computation and number of examples used for selection.

Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners.   In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This \"double descent\" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses, and has implications for both the theory and practice of machine learning."},{"id":"1609.04994v3","title":"Exploration Potential","authors":"Jan Leike","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1609.04994v3","content":"We introduce exploration potential, a quantity that measures how much a reinforcement learning agent has explored its environment class.

Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is a well-defined function, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: one measurement may map to multiple different sets of parameters. In this setting, the posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an input measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task -- so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Although INNs are not new, they have, so far, received little attention in literature. While classical neural networks attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs are able to learn it jointly with the well-defined forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Given a specific measurement and sampled latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides a full distribution over parameter space. We verify experimentally, on artificial data and real-world problems from astrophysics and medicine, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space, to uncover parameter correlations, and to identify unrecoverable parameters."},{"id":"1910.09338v1","title":"An Alternative Surrogate Loss for PGD-based Adversarial Testing","authors":"Sven Gowal, Jonathan Uesato, Chongli Qin, Po-Sen Huang, Timothy Mann, Pushmeet Kohli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.09338v1","content":"Adversarial testing methods based on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) are widely used for searching norm-bounded perturbations that cause the inputs of neural networks to be misclassified.

Since this past data may be biased, machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices. In this paper, we develop a framework for modeling fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it is the same in (a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group.

We show that when a human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act according to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than a robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its owner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers the human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of obedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot has a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the level of rationality of the human. Finally, we study how robots can start detecting such model misspecification. Overall, our work suggests that there might be a middle ground in which robots intelligently decide when to obey human orders, but err on the side of obedience."},{"id":"1903.06758v2","title":"Algorithms for Verifying Deep Neural Networks","authors":"Changliu Liu, Tomer Arnon, Christopher Lazarus, Christopher Strong, Clark Barrett, Mykel J.

Our framework enables the research community to test ImageNet model robustness against attacks not encountered during training. To create ImageNet-UA's diverse attack suite, we introduce a total of four novel adversarial attacks. We also demonstrate that, in comparison to ImageNet-UA, prevailing L_inf robustness assessments give a narrow account of model robustness.

Since mathematical logic is a powerful tool for reasoning about computer programs, we consider this problem from the perspective of integrating probability and logic. Recent work on assigning probabilities to mathematical statements has used the concept of coherent distributions, which satisfy logical constraints such as the probability of a sentence and its negation summing to one. Although there are algorithms which converge to a coherent probability distribution in the limit, this yields only weak guarantees about finite approximations of these distributions. In our setting, this is a significant limitation: Coherent distributions assign probability one to all statements provable in a specific logical theory, such as Peano Arithmetic, which can prove what the output of any terminating computation is; thus, a coherent distribution must assign probability one to the output of any terminating computation. To model uncertainty about computations, we propose to work with approximations to coherent distributions. We introduce inductive coherence, a strengthening of coherence that provides appropriate constraints on finite approximations, and propose an algorithm which satisfies this criterion."},{"id":"1311.2901v3","title":"Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks","authors":"Matthew D Zeiler, Rob Fergus","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1311.2901v3","content":"Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark.

In practice, this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy, with the reset policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the reset policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts.

We introduce ConTRoL, a new dataset for ConTextual Reasoning over Long texts. Consisting of 8,325 expert-designed \"context-hypothesis\" pairs with gold labels, ConTRoL is a passage-level NLI dataset with a focus on complex contextual reasoning types such as logical reasoning. It is derived from competitive selection and recruitment test (verbal reasoning test) for police recruitment, with expert level quality. Compared with previous NLI benchmarks, the materials in ConTRoL are much more challenging, involving a range of reasoning types. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art language models perform by far worse than educated humans.

In this talk, we explore the threat model space of ML algorithms through the lens of Saltzer and Schroeder's principles for the design of secure computer systems. This characterization of the threat space prompts an investigation of current and future research directions. We structure our discussion around three of these directions, which we believe are likely to lead to significant progress. The first encompasses a spectrum of approaches to verification and admission control, which is a prerequisite to enable fail-safe defaults in machine learning systems. The second seeks to design mechanisms for assembling reliable records of compromise that would help understand the degree to which vulnerabilities are exploited by adversaries, as well as favor psychological acceptability of machine learning applications. The third pursues formal frameworks for security and privacy in machine learning, which we argue should strive to align machine learning goals such as generalization with security and privacy desiderata like robustness or privacy. Key insights resulting from these three directions pursued both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by systematizing best practices in our community."},{"id":"2006.04734v3","title":"Reinforcement Learning Under Moral Uncertainty","authors":"Adrien Ecoffet, Joel Lehman","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.04734v3","content":"An ambitious goal for machine learning is to create agents that behave ethically: The capacity to abide by human moral norms would greatly expand the context in which autonomous agents could be practically and safely deployed, e.g. fully autonomous vehicles will encounter charged moral decisions that complicate their deployment. While ethical agents could be trained by rewarding correct behavior under a specific moral theory (e.g. utilitarianism), there remains widespread disagreement about the nature of morality. Acknowledging such disagreement, recent work in moral philosophy proposes that ethical behavior requires acting under moral uncertainty, i.e. to take into account when acting that one's credence is split across several plausible ethical theories. This paper translates such insights to the field of reinforcement learning, proposes two training methods that realize different points among competing desiderata, and trains agents in simple environments to act under moral uncertainty. The results illustrate (1) how such uncertainty can help curb extreme behavior from commitment to single theories and (2) several technical complications arising from attempting to ground moral philosophy in RL (e.g. how can a principled trade-off between two competing but incomparable reward functions be reached). The aim is to catalyze progress towards morally-competent agents and highlight the potential of RL to contribute towards the computational grounding of moral philosophy."},{"id":"1810.02334v6","title":"Unsupervised Learning via Meta-Learning","authors":"Kyle Hsu, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.02334v6","content":"A central goal of unsupervised learning is to acquire representations from unlabeled data or experience that can be used for more effective learning of downstream tasks from modest amounts of labeled data.

Instead, we develop an unsupervised meta-learning method that explicitly optimizes for the ability to learn a variety of tasks from small amounts of data. To do so, we construct tasks from unlabeled data in an automatic way and run meta-learning over the constructed tasks. Surprisingly, we find that, when integrated with meta-learning, relatively simple task construction mechanisms, such as clustering embeddings, lead to good performance on a variety of downstream, human-specified tasks.

In this work, we study how a robot can similarly provide feedback that is minimally disruptive, yet gives human teachers a better mental model of the robot learner, and thus enables them to teach more effectively. Our idea is that at any point, the robot can indicate what it thinks the correct next action is, shedding light on its current estimate of the human's preferences. We analyze how useful this feedback is, both in theory and with two user studies---one with a virtual character that tests the feedback itself, and one with a PR2 robot that uses gaze as the feedback mechanism. We find that feedback can be useful for improving both the quality of teaching and teachers' understanding of the robot's capability."},{"id":"1602.04019v1","title":"Energetics of the brain and AI","authors":"Anders Sandberg","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1602.04019v1","content":"Does the energy requirements for the human brain give energy constraints that give reason to doubt the feasibility of artificial intelligence?

Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order to capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting convolutional models with content-based interactions, such as self-attention and non-local means, to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form of self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional model that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a pure self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate that self-attention is especially impactful when used in later layers. These results establish that stand-alone self-attention is an important addition to the vision practitioner's toolbox."},{"id":"2003.04881v6","title":"Pruned Neural Networks are Surprisingly Modular","authors":"Daniel Filan, Shlomi Hod, Cody Wild, Andrew Critch, Stuart Russell","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2003.04881v6","content":"The learned weights of a neural network are often considered devoid of scrutable internal structure.

We find that training and weight pruning produces MLPs that are more modular than randomly initialized ones, and often significantly more modular than random MLPs with the same (sparse) distribution of weights. Interestingly, they are much more modular when trained with dropout. We also present exploratory analyses of the importance of different modules for performance and how modules depend on each other. Understanding the modular structure of neural networks, when such structure exists, will hopefully render their inner workings more interpretable to engineers.

This paper presents an IRL framework called Bayesian optimization-IRL (BO-IRL) which identifies multiple solutions that are consistent with the expert demonstrations by efficiently exploring the reward function space. BO-IRL achieves this by utilizing Bayesian Optimization along with our newly proposed kernel that (a) projects the parameters of policy invariant reward functions to a single point in a latent space and (b) ensures nearby points in the latent space correspond to reward functions yielding similar likelihoods. This projection allows the use of standard stationary kernels in the latent space to capture the correlations present across the reward function space.

Roy, Michael Carbin","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1903.01611v3","content":"Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise.

With the advent of generally capable agents that pretrain on many environments, it will become necessary to mitigate inherited biases from environments that teach immoral behavior. To facilitate the development of agents that avoid causing wanton harm, we introduce Jiminy Cricket, an environment suite of 25 text-based adventure games with thousands of diverse, morally salient scenarios. By annotating every possible game state, the Jiminy Cricket environments robustly evaluate whether agents can act morally while maximizing reward.

Since a robot's behavior is often a direct result of its underlying objective function, our insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, and then it selects those behaviors that are maximally informative. The problem of computing a posterior over objectives from observed behavior is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied to robots learning human objectives. We consider the problem where the roles of human and robot are swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike robots, humans will not be exact in their IRL inference. We thus introduce two factors to define candidate approximate-inference models for human learning in this setting, and analyze them in a user study in the autonomous driving domain. We show that certain approximate-inference models lead to the robot generating example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what it will do in novel situations.

This is especially critical for planning in complex multi-agent environments, where agents need to anticipate other agents' intentions and possible future actions. Traditional methods formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, but the solutions often rely on various assumptions and become brittle when presented with corner cases. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been very effective at finding policies by simultaneously exploring, interacting, and learning from environments. Leveraging the powerful Deep RL paradigm, we demonstrate that an iterative procedure of self-play can create progressively more diverse environments, leading to the learning of sophisticated and robust multi-agent policies. We demonstrate this in a challenging multi-agent simulation of merging traffic, where agents must interact and negotiate with others in order to successfully merge on or off the road. While the environment starts off simple, we increase its complexity by iteratively adding an increasingly diverse set of agents to the agent \"zoo\" as training progresses. Qualitatively, we find that through self-play, our policies automatically learn interesting behaviors such as defensive driving, overtaking, yielding, and the use of signal lights to communicate intentions to other agents. In addition, quantitatively, we show a dramatic improvement of the success rate of merging maneuvers from 63% to over 98%."},{"id":"1805.08010v4","title":"Where Do You Think You're Going?: Inferring Beliefs about Dynamics from Behavior","authors":"Siddharth Reddy, Anca D.

These methods infer a goal or reward function that best explains the actions of the observed agent, typically a human demonstrator. Another agent can use this inferred intent to predict, imitate, or assist the human user. However, a central assumption in inverse reinforcement learning is that the demonstrator is close to optimal. While models of suboptimal behavior exist, they typically assume that suboptimal actions are the result of some type of random noise or a known cognitive bias, like temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we take an alternative approach, and model suboptimal behavior as the result of internal model misspecification: the reason that user actions might deviate from near-optimal actions is that the user has an incorrect set of beliefs about the rules -- the dynamics -- governing how actions affect the environment. Our insight is that while demonstrated actions may be suboptimal in the real world, they may actually be near-optimal with respect to the user's internal model of the dynamics. By estimating these internal beliefs from observed behavior, we arrive at a new method for inferring intent. We demonstrate in simulation and in a user study with 12 participants that this approach enables us to more accurately model human intent, and can be used in a variety of applications, including offering assistance in a shared autonomy framework and inferring human preferences."},{"id":"1809.03956v1","title":"Abstraction Learning","authors":"Fei Deng, Jinsheng Ren, Feng Chen","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1809.03956v1","content":"There has been a gap between artificial intelligence and human intelligence.

In this paper, we consider the problem of taking a neural network whose neurons are partitioned into clusters, and quantifying how functionally specialized the clusters are. We propose two proxies for this: importance, which reflects how crucial sets of neurons are to network performance; and coherence, which reflects how consistently their neurons associate with features of the inputs. To measure these proxies, we develop a set of statistical methods based on techniques conventionally used to interpret individual neurons. We apply the proxies to partitionings generated by spectrally clustering a graph representation of the network's neurons with edges determined either by network weights or correlations of activations. We show that these partitionings, even ones based only on weights (i.e. strictly from non-runtime analysis), reveal groups of neurons that are important and coherent.

AugMix significantly improves robustness and uncertainty measures on challenging image classification benchmarks, closing the gap between previous methods and the best possible performance in some cases by more than half."},{"id":"2010.11929v2","title":"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale","authors":"Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, Neil Houlsby","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2010.11929v2","content":"While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited.

When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train."},{"id":"2001.09773v1","title":"Algorithmic Fairness from a Non-ideal Perspective","authors":"Sina Fazelpour, Zachary C. Lipton","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2001.09773v1","content":"Inspired by recent breakthroughs in predictive modeling, practitioners in both industry and government have turned to machine learning with hopes of operationalizing predictions to drive automated decisions. Unfortunately, many social desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or fairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework. In efforts to mitigate these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of metrics for quantifying deviations from various statistical parities that we might expect to observe in a fair world and offered a variety of algorithms in attempts to satisfy subsets of these parities or to trade off the degree to which they are satisfied against utility. In this paper, we connect this approach to \\emph{fair machine learning} to the literature on ideal and non-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach requires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate. In the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a proposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and the perfectly just world. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by which our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various decision-makers, and the impacts of proposed policies, naive applications of ideal thinking can lead to misguided interventions. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between the fair machine learning literature and the ideal approach in political philosophy, and argue that the increasingly apparent shortcomings of proposed fair machine learning algorithms reflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach. We conclude with a critical discussion of the harms of misguided solutions, a reinterpretation of impossibility results, and directions for future research."},{"id":"2002.09571v2","title":"Learning to Continually Learn","authors":"Shawn Beaulieu, Lapo Frati, Thomas Miconi, Joel Lehman, Kenneth O. Stanley, Jeff Clune, Nick Cheney","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2002.09571v2","content":"Continual lifelong learning requires an agent or model to learn many sequentially ordered tasks, building on previous knowledge without catastrophically forgetting it. Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates)."},{"id":"1807.11655v4","title":"Security and Privacy Issues in Deep Learning","authors":"Ho Bae, Jaehee Jang, Dahuin Jung, Hyemi Jang, Heonseok Ha, Hyungyu Lee, Sungroh Yoon","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1807.11655v4","content":"To promote secure and private artificial intelligence (SPAI), we review studies on the model security and data privacy of DNNs. Model security allows system to behave as intended without being affected by malicious external influences that can compromise its integrity and efficiency. Security attacks can be divided based on when they occur: if an attack occurs during training, it is known as a poisoning attack, and if it occurs during inference (after training) it is termed an evasion attack. Poisoning attacks compromise the training process by corrupting the data with malicious examples, while evasion attacks use adversarial examples to disrupt entire classification process. Defenses proposed against such attacks include techniques to recognize and remove malicious data, train a model to be insensitive to such data, and mask the model's structure and parameters to render attacks more challenging to implement. Furthermore, the privacy of the data involved in model training is also threatened by attacks such as the model-inversion attack, or by dishonest service providers of AI applications. To maintain data privacy, several solutions that combine existing data-privacy techniques have been proposed, including differential privacy and modern cryptography techniques.

Dynamic adversarial data collection (DADC), where annotators craft examples that challenge continually improving models, holds promise as an approach for generating such diverse training sets. Prior work has shown that running DADC over 1-3 rounds can help models fix some error types, but it does not necessarily lead to better generalization beyond adversarial test data. We argue that running DADC over many rounds maximizes its training-time benefits, as the different rounds can together cover many of the task-relevant phenomena. We present the first study of longer-term DADC, where we collect 20 rounds of NLI examples for a small set of premise paragraphs, with both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches. Models trained on DADC examples make 26% fewer errors on our expert-curated test set compared to models trained on non-adversarial data. Our analysis shows that DADC yields examples that are more difficult, more lexically and syntactically diverse, and contain fewer annotation artifacts compared to non-adversarial examples."},{"id":"2105.04857v1","title":"Leveraging Sparse Linear Layers for Debuggable Deep Networks","authors":"Eric Wong, Shibani Santurkar, Aleksander M\u0105dry","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2105.04857v1","content":"We show how fitting sparse linear models over learned deep feature representations can lead to more debuggable neural networks.

When we do the same for models pre-trained on a large language dataset, the slope in performance gains is merely reduced rather than going to zero. We calculate the effective data \"transferred\" from pre-training by determining how much data a transformer of the same size would have required to achieve the same loss when training from scratch. In other words, we focus on units of data while holding everything else fixed. We find that the effective data transferred is described well in the low data regime by a power-law of parameter count and fine-tuning dataset size. We believe the exponents in these power-laws correspond to measures of the generality of a model and proximity of distributions (in a directed rather than symmetric sense).

Using an ensemble of learned dynamic models, MB-MPO meta-learns a policy that can quickly adapt to any model in the ensemble with one policy gradient step. This steers the meta-policy towards internalizing consistent dynamics predictions among the ensemble while shifting the burden of behaving optimally w.r.t. the model discrepancies towards the adaptation step. Our experiments show that MB-MPO is more robust to model imperfections than previous model-based approaches.

The resulting approach, latent embedding optimization (LEO), decouples the gradient-based adaptation procedure from the underlying high-dimensional space of model parameters.

What makes it challenging to use a decentralized approach to collectively optimize a central objective is the difficulty in characterizing the equilibrium strategy profile of non-cooperative games. To overcome this challenge, we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each agent for which we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives. The society functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment state. We derive a class of decentralized reinforcement learning algorithms that are broadly applicable not only to standard reinforcement learning but also for selecting options in semi-MDPs and dynamically composing computation graphs.

Recent work has suggested that people have an interest in the robot performing well, and will thus behave pedagogically, choosing actions that are informative to the robot. In turn, robots benefit from interpreting the behavior by accounting for this pedagogy. In this work, we focus on misspecification: we argue that robots might not know whether people are being pedagogic or literal and that it is important to ask which assumption is safer to make. We cast objective learning into the more general form of a common-payoff game between the robot and human, and prove that in any such game literal interpretation is more robust to misspecification.

Specifically, we propose a novel generalized-mean-loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and \"snap\" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a \"theory hub\", which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the toy \"AI Physicist\" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly.

To test this hypothesis, we focus on a task that involves gluing pairs of blocks together to stabilize a tower, and quantify how well humans perform. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning agent which uses object- and relation-centric scene and policy representations and apply it to the task.

While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI \"lies\" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures.   Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful.   Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding \"negligent falsehoods\" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction.   A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda.

These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited models and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system.

However, these robots first need to learn what it is their user wants them to do. Teaching assistive robots is hard for inexperienced users, elderly users, and users living with physical disabilities, since often these individuals are unable to show the robot their desired behavior. We know that inclusive learners should give human teachers credit for what they cannot demonstrate. But today's robots do the opposite: they assume every user is capable of providing any demonstration. As a result, these robots learn to mimic the demonstrated behavior, even when that behavior is not what the human really meant! Here we propose a different approach to reward learning: robots that reason about the user's demonstrations in the context of similar or simpler alternatives. Unlike prior works -- which err towards overestimating the human's capabilities -- here we err towards underestimating what the human can input (i.e., their choice set). Our theoretical analysis proves that underestimating the human's choice set is risk-averse, with better worst-case performance than overestimating.

First, the branches of conditionals and bodies of loops can be partitioned across many machines to run on a set of heterogeneous devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and custom ASICs. Second, programs written in our model support automatic differentiation and distributed gradient computations, which are necessary for training machine learning models that use control flow. Third, our choice of non-strict semantics enables multiple loop iterations to execute in parallel across machines, and to overlap compute and I\/O operations.   We have done our work in the context of TensorFlow, and it has been used extensively in research and production. We evaluate it using several real-world applications, and demonstrate its performance and scalability."},{"id":"2004.14990v5","title":"Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data","authors":"Michael Laskin, Kimin Lee, Adam Stooke, Lerrel Pinto, Pieter Abbeel, Aravind Srinivas","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.14990v5","content":"Learning from visual observations is a fundamental yet challenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Although algorithmic advances combined with convolutional neural networks have proved to be a recipe for success, current methods are still lacking on two fronts: (a) data-efficiency of learning and (b) generalization to new environments. To this end, we present Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data (RAD), a simple plug-and-play module that can enhance most RL algorithms. We perform the first extensive study of general data augmentations for RL on both pixel-based and state-based inputs, and introduce two new data augmentations - random translate and random amplitude scale. We show that augmentations such as random translate, crop, color jitter, patch cutout, random convolutions, and amplitude scale can enable simple RL algorithms to outperform complex state-of-the-art methods across common benchmarks. RAD sets a new state-of-the-art in terms of data-efficiency and final performance on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark for pixel-based control as well as OpenAI Gym benchmark for state-based control. We further demonstrate that RAD significantly improves test-time generalization over existing methods on several OpenAI ProcGen benchmarks.

Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data."},{"id":"1812.02795v1","title":"Verification of deep probabilistic models","authors":"Krishnamurthy Dvijotham, Marta Garnelo, Alhussein Fawzi, Pushmeet Kohli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1812.02795v1","content":"Probabilistic models are a critical part of the modern deep learning toolbox - ranging from generative models (VAEs, GANs), sequence to sequence models used in machine translation and speech processing to models over functional spaces (conditional neural processes, neural processes). Given the size and complexity of these models, safely deploying them in applications requires the development of tools to analyze their behavior rigorously and provide some guarantees that these models are consistent with a list of desirable properties or specifications. For example, a machine translation model should produce semantically equivalent outputs for innocuous changes in the input to the model. A functional regression model that is learning a distribution over monotonic functions should predict a larger value at a larger input. Verification of these properties requires a new framework that goes beyond notions of verification studied in deterministic feedforward networks, since requiring worst-case guarantees in probabilistic models is likely to produce conservative or vacuous results. We propose a novel formulation of verification for deep probabilistic models that take in conditioning inputs and sample latent variables in the course of producing an output: We require that the output of the model satisfies a linear constraint with high probability over the sampling of latent variables and for every choice of conditioning input to the model. We show that rigorous lower bounds on the probability that the constraint is satisfied can be obtained efficiently. Experiments with neural processes show that several properties of interest while modeling functional spaces can be modeled within this framework (monotonicity, convexity) and verified efficiently using our algorithms"},{"id":"1903.03088v1","title":"Self-Tuning Networks: Bilevel Optimization of Hyperparameters using Structured Best-Response Functions","authors":"Matthew MacKay, Paul Vicol, Jon Lorraine, David Duvenaud, Roger Grosse","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1903.03088v1","content":"Hyperparameter optimization can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, where the optimal parameters on the training set depend on the hyperparameters. We aim to adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function, which maps hyperparameters to optimal weights and biases. We show how to construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer. We justify this approximation by showing the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian can be represented by a similar gating mechanism. We fit this model using a gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm which alternates between approximating the best-response around the current hyperparameters and optimizing the hyperparameters using the approximate best-response function. Unlike other gradient-based approaches, we do not require differentiating the training loss with respect to the hyperparameters, allowing us to tune discrete hyperparameters, data augmentation hyperparameters, and dropout probabilities. Because the hyperparameters are adapted online, our approach discovers hyperparameter schedules that can outperform fixed hyperparameter values. Empirically, our approach outperforms competing hyperparameter optimization methods on large-scale deep learning problems. We call our networks, which update their own hyperparameters online during training, Self-Tuning Networks (STNs)."},{"id":"2004.10802v1","title":"A Neural Scaling Law from the Dimension of the Data Manifold","authors":"Utkarsh Sharma, Jared Kaplan","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.10802v1","content":"When data is plentiful, the loss achieved by well-trained neural networks scales as a power-law $L \\propto N^{-\\alpha}$ in the number of network parameters $N$.

However, when neural networks are trained in a fixed environment, such as a single level in a video game, they will usually overfit and fail to generalize to new levels. When RL models overfit, even slight modifications to the environment can result in poor agent performance. This paper explores how procedurally generated levels during training can increase generality. We show that for some games procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the same distribution. Additionally, it is possible to achieve better performance with less data by manipulating the difficulty of the levels in response to the performance of the agent. The generality of the learned behaviors is also evaluated on a set of human-designed levels. The results suggest that the ability to generalize to human-designed levels highly depends on the design of the level generators. We apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to visualize the generators' distributions of levels and analyze to what degree they can produce levels similar to those designed by a human."},{"id":"2108.07732v1","title":"Program Synthesis with Large Language Models","authors":"Jacob Austin, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Maarten Bosma, Henryk Michalewski, David Dohan, Ellen Jiang, Carrie Cai, Michael Terry, Quoc Le, Charles Sutton","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2108.07732v1","content":"This paper explores the limits of the current generation of large language models for program synthesis in general purpose programming languages.

Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974 programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914 problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more complex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest fine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the model's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to improve its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human halves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally, we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and what types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the semantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results of program execution.

However, it is yet unknown whether this approach is feasible in complex 3D environments with feedback obtained from real humans - whether sufficient pixel-based neural simulator quality can be achieved, and whether the human data requirements are viable in terms of both quantity and quality.

Adversarial examples are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary that classifies the low-dimensional data manifold well, but classifies points near the manifold incorrectly.

Recent prior works have proposed methods for test time adaptation, however, they each introduce additional assumptions, such as access to multiple test points, that prevent widespread adoption. In this work, we aim to study and devise methods that make no assumptions about the model training process and are broadly applicable at test time. We propose a simple approach that can be used in any test setting where the model is probabilistic and adaptable: when presented with a test example, perform different data augmentations on the data point, and then adapt (all of) the model parameters by minimizing the entropy of the model's average, or marginal, output distribution across the augmentations. Intuitively, this objective encourages the model to make the same prediction across different augmentations, thus enforcing the invariances encoded in these augmentations, while also maintaining confidence in its predictions. In our experiments, we evaluate two baseline ResNet models, two robust ResNet-50 models, and a robust vision transformer model, and we demonstrate that this approach achieves accuracy gains of 1-8\\% over standard model evaluation and also generally outperforms prior augmentation and adaptation strategies.

We design a new untargeted attack, based on these best practices, using the established logarithmic barrier method. On average, our attack distance is similar or better than all state-of-the-art attacks on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet-1K). In addition, our method performs significantly better on the most challenging images, those which normally require larger perturbations for misclassification.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.

While recent studies suggest that ViTs are more robust than their convolutional counterparts, our experiments find that ViTs trained on ImageNet are overly reliant on local textures and fail to make adequate use of shape information. ViTs thus have difficulties generalizing to out-of-distribution, real-world data. To address this deficiency, we present a simple and effective architecture modification to ViT's input layer by adding discrete tokens produced by a vector-quantized encoder. Different from the standard continuous pixel tokens, discrete tokens are invariant under small perturbations and contain less information individually, which promote ViTs to learn global information that is invariant. Experimental results demonstrate that adding discrete representation on four architecture variants strengthens ViT robustness by up to 12% across seven ImageNet robustness benchmarks while maintaining the performance on ImageNet."},{"id":"1905.01067v4","title":"Deconstructing Lottery Tickets: Zeros, Signs, and the Supermask","authors":"Hattie Zhou, Janice Lan, Rosanne Liu, Jason Yosinski","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1905.01067v4","content":"The recent \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" paper by Frankle & Carbin showed that a simple approach to creating sparse networks (keeping the large weights) results in models that are trainable from scratch, but only when starting from the same initial weights.

In this paper we study the three critical components of the Lottery Ticket (LT) algorithm, showing that each may be varied significantly without impacting the overall results. Ablating these factors leads to new insights for why LT networks perform as well as they do. We show why setting weights to zero is important, how signs are all you need to make the reinitialized network train, and why masking behaves like training. Finally, we discover the existence of Supermasks, masks that can be applied to an untrained, randomly initialized network to produce a model with performance far better than chance (86% on MNIST, 41% on CIFAR-10)."},{"id":"1811.07834v3","title":"Safely Probabilistically Complete Real-Time Planning and Exploration in Unknown Environments","authors":"David Fridovich-Keil, Jaime F.

Beling","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1806.09795v3","content":"This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL) in a two-player general-sum stochastic game framework. Five variants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and uNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a cooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to maximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to follow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing total game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value maximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium. Problems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial equilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel approaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game observer either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution concepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of solutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a Bayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming problem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions for the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to choose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference between the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of the solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The remaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of solution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem. Results are validated on various benchmark grid-world games."},{"id":"1912.01412v1","title":"Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics","authors":"Guillaume Lample, Fran\u00e7ois Charton","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1912.01412v1","content":"Neural networks have a reputation for being better at solving statistical or approximate problems than at performing calculations or working with symbolic data.

We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference.

(2016) formally show that providing an option to self-modify is harmless for perfectly rational agents. We show that this result is no longer true for agents with bounded rationality. In such agents, self-modification may cause exponential deterioration in performance and gradual misalignment of a previously aligned agent. We investigate how the size of this effect depends on the type and magnitude of imperfections in the agent's rationality (1-4 below). We also discuss model assumptions and the wider problem and framing space.   We examine four ways in which an agent can be bounded-rational: it either (1) doesn't always choose the optimal action, (2) is not perfectly aligned with human values, (3) has an inaccurate model of the environment, or (4) uses the wrong temporal discounting factor.

In this work, we approach the problem from the opposite direction: to formally verify a system's robustness against a predefined class of adversarial attacks. We study text classification under synonym replacements or character flip perturbations. We propose modeling these input perturbations as a simplex and then using Interval Bound Propagation -- a formal model verification method. We modify the conventional log-likelihood training objective to train models that can be efficiently verified, which would otherwise come with exponential search complexity. The resulting models show only little difference in terms of nominal accuracy, but have much improved verified accuracy under perturbations and come with an efficiently computable formal guarantee on worst case adversaries."},{"id":"1710.05060v2","title":"Functional Decision Theory: A New Theory of Instrumental Rationality","authors":"Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nate Soares","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1710.05060v2","content":"This paper describes and motivates a new decision theory known as functional decision theory (FDT), as distinct from causal decision theory and evidential decision theory.

Using one simple and coherent decision rule, functional decision theorists (for example) achieve more utility than CDT on Newcomb's problem, more utility than EDT on the smoking lesion problem, and more utility than both in Parfit's hitchhiker problem.

Tomlin","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.13369v2","content":"Real-world autonomous systems often employ probabilistic predictive models of human behavior during planning to reason about their future motion. Since accurately modeling human behavior a priori is challenging, such models are often parameterized, enabling the robot to adapt predictions based on observations by maintaining a distribution over the model parameters. Although this enables data and priors to improve the human model, observation models are difficult to specify and priors may be incorrect, leading to erroneous state predictions that can degrade the safety of the robot motion plan. In this work, we seek to design a predictor which is more robust to misspecified models and priors, but can still leverage human behavioral data online to reduce conservatism in a safe way. To do this, we cast human motion prediction as a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problem in the joint state space of the human and the belief over the model parameters. We construct a new continuous-time dynamical system, where the inputs are the observations of human behavior, and the dynamics include how the belief over the model parameters change. The results of this reachability computation enable us to both analyze the effect of incorrect priors on future predictions in continuous state and time, as well as to make predictions of the human state in the future. We compare our approach to the worst-case forward reachable set and a stochastic predictor which uses Bayesian inference and produces full future state distributions. Our comparisons in simulation and in hardware demonstrate how our framework can enable robust planning while not being overly conservative, even when the human model is inaccurate."},{"id":"2012.01557v2","title":"Value Alignment Verification","authors":"Daniel S.

We show that determination of whether an agent meets any particular standard is not computable. We discuss the extent of the burden associated with verification by manual proof and by automated behavioral governance. We show that to ensure decidability of the behavioral standard itself, one must further limit the capabilities of the agent. We then demonstrate that if our concerns relate to outcomes in the physical world, attempts at validation are futile. Finally, we show that layered architectures aimed at making these challenges tractable mistakenly equate intentions with actions or outcomes, thereby failing to provide any guarantees.

In contrast to approaches asking the designer for optimal behavior, this allows us to gather additional information by eliciting preferences between suboptimal behaviors. After each query, we need to update the posterior over the true reward function from observing the proxy reward function chosen by the designer.

However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization.

Akin to how humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable learning.

In robotics, value alignment is key to the design of collaborative robots that can integrate into human workflows, successfully inferring and adapting to their users' objectives as they go. We argue that a meaningful solution to value alignment must combine multi-agent decision theory with rich mathematical models of human cognition, enabling robots to tap into people's natural collaborative capabilities. We present a solution to the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) dynamic game based on well-established cognitive models of decision making and theory of mind. The solution captures a key reciprocity relation: the human will not plan her actions in isolation, but rather reason pedagogically about how the robot might learn from them; the robot, in turn, can anticipate this and interpret the human's actions pragmatically. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first formal analysis of value alignment grounded in empirically validated cognitive models."},{"id":"1805.07722v1","title":"Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Few-shot Learning","authors":"Muhammad Abdullah Jamal, Guo-Jun Qi, Mubarak Shah","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1805.07722v1","content":"Meta-learning approaches have been proposed to tackle the few-shot learning problem.Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined.Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks."},{"id":"1611.08219v3","title":"The Off-Switch Game","authors":"Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, Stuart Russell","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1611.08219v3","content":"It is clear that one of the primary tools we can use to mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents."},{"id":"1905.06922v1","title":"On Variational Bounds of Mutual Information","authors":"Ben Poole, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron van den Oord, Alexander A.

To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly trades off bias and variance.

However, understanding the information represented and processed in CNNs remains in most cases challenging. Within this paper, we explore the use of new information theoretic techniques developed in the field of neuroscience to enable novel understanding of how a CNN represents information. We trained a 10-layer ResNet architecture to identify 2,000 face identities from 26M images generated using a rigorously controlled 3D face rendering model that produced variations of intrinsic (i.e. face morphology, gender, age, expression and ethnicity) and extrinsic factors (i.e. 3D pose, illumination, scale and 2D translation). With our methodology, we demonstrate that unlike human's network overgeneralizes face identities even with extreme changes of face shape, but it is more sensitive to changes of texture. To understand the processing of information underlying these counterintuitive properties, we visualize the features of shape and texture that the network processes to identify faces. Then, we shed a light into the inner workings of the black box and reveal how hidden layers represent these features and whether the representations are invariant to pose. We hope that our methodology will provide an additional valuable tool for interpretability of CNNs."},{"id":"1906.08237v2","title":"XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding","authors":"Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Quoc V.

In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining.

Unlike prior work in more restricted settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary natural language specification and generate satisfactory Python code. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers, we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially as models improve. Recent models such as GPT-Neo can pass approximately 20% of the test cases of introductory problems, so we find that machine learning models are now beginning to learn how to code.

While algorithm-driven social media does not seem to be a primary driver of polarization at the country level, it could be a useful intervention point in polarized societies. This paper examines algorithmic depolarization interventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or eliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic intervention is considered at three stages: which content is available (moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content presentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online conflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an antidote to \"filter bubbles\" can be improved and can even worsen polarization under some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in content selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions have not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic contexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization dynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics, such as the widely used \"feeling thermometer.\" These metrics can be used to evaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic objectives. It may further prove necessary to include polarization measures in the objective functions of recommender algorithms to prevent optimization processes from creating conflict as a side effect."},{"id":"1806.00109v1","title":"Probabilistically Safe Robot Planning with Confidence-Based Human Predictions","authors":"Jaime F.

Unfortunately, these models cannot capture the full complexity of human behavior and necessarily introduce simplifying assumptions.

In this paper, we observe that how \"rational\" human actions appear under a particular model can be viewed as an indicator of that model's ability to describe the human's current motion. By reasoning about this model confidence in a real-time Bayesian framework, we show that the robot can very quickly modulate its predictions to become more uncertain when the model performs poorly. Building on recent work in provably-safe trajectory planning, we leverage these confidence-aware human motion predictions to generate assured autonomous robot motion. Our new analysis combines worst-case tracking error guarantees for the physical robot with probabilistic time-varying human predictions, yielding a quantitative, probabilistic safety certificate.

Our key insight is to minimize the right divergence between the learner and the expert state-action distributions, namely the reverse KL divergence or I-projection. We propose a general imitation learning framework for estimating and minimizing any f-Divergence. By plugging in different divergences, we are able to recover existing algorithms such as Behavior Cloning (Kullback-Leibler), GAIL (Jensen Shannon) and Dagger (Total Variation).

Thus changes to the network parameters during training are biased towards those that (locally) simultaneously benefit many examples when such similarity exists. We support this hypothesis with heuristic arguments and perturbative experiments and outline how this can explain several common empirical observations about Deep Learning.

However, deep neural networks are often under- or over-confident in their predictions.

When incorporated into training, these soft calibration losses achieve state-of-the-art single-model ECE across multiple datasets with less than 1% decrease in accuracy. For instance, we observe an 82% reduction in ECE (70% relative to the post-hoc rescaled ECE) in exchange for a 0.7% relative decrease in accuracy relative to the cross entropy baseline on CIFAR-100. When incorporated post-training, the soft-binning-based calibration error objective improves upon temperature scaling, a popular recalibration method. Overall, experiments across losses and datasets demonstrate that using calibration-sensitive procedures yield better uncertainty estimates under dataset shift than the standard practice of using a cross entropy loss and post-hoc recalibration methods."},{"id":"1512.02595v1","title":"Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin","authors":"Dario Amodei, Rishita Anubhai, Eric Battenberg, Carl Case, Jared Casper, Bryan Catanzaro, Jingdong Chen, Mike Chrzanowski, Adam Coates, Greg Diamos, Erich Elsen, Jesse Engel, Linxi Fan, Christopher Fougner, Tony Han, Awni Hannun, Billy Jun, Patrick LeGresley, Libby Lin, Sharan Narang, Andrew Ng, Sherjil Ozair, Ryan Prenger, Jonathan Raiman, Sanjeev Satheesh, David Seetapun, Shubho Sengupta, Yi Wang, Zhiqian Wang, Chong Wang, Bo Xiao, Dani Yogatama, Jun Zhan, Zhenyao Zhu","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1512.02595v1","content":"We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech--two vastly different languages.

The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides \"hard negatives\" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon \"corrective feedback.\" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range of challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy reward signals.

This leads to a performance breakdown to the level of random guessing when training on scenarios where visual cues are inversely correlated with stability. Using stethoscopes to promote meaningful feature extraction increases performance from 51% to 90% prediction accuracy.

How","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.06496v6","content":"Deep Neural Network-based systems are now the state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task. This work extends one of our prior works with new performance guarantees, extensions to other RL algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm."},{"id":"2104.08691v2","title":"The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning","authors":"Brian Lester, Rami Al-Rfou, Noah Constant","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2104.08691v2","content":"In this work, we explore \"prompt tuning\", a simple yet effective mechanism for learning \"soft prompts\" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signal from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's \"few-shot\" learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method \"closes the gap\" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant in that large models are costly to share and serve, and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed \"prefix tuning\" of Li and Liang (2021), and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer, as compared to full model tuning."},{"id":"1805.08336v2","title":"Maximum Causal Tsallis Entropy Imitation Learning","authors":"Kyungjae Lee, Sungjoon Choi, Songhwai Oh","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1805.08336v2","content":"In this paper, we propose a novel maximum causal Tsallis entropy (MCTE) framework for imitation learning which can efficiently learn a sparse multi-modal policy distribution from demonstrations.

The proposed method has advantages over a softmax distribution in that it can exclude unnecessary actions by assigning zero probability. Second, we prove that an MCTE problem is equivalent to robust Bayes estimation in the sense of the Brier score. Third, we propose a maximum causal Tsallis entropy imitation learning (MCTEIL) algorithm with a sparse mixture density network (sparse MDN) by modeling mixture weights using a sparsemax distribution.

The most promising defenses, adversarially robust training and verifiably robust training, have limitations that restrict their practical applications. The adversarially robust training only makes the networks robust against a subclass of attackers and we reveal such weaknesses by developing a new attack based on interval gradients. By contrast, verifiably robust training provides protection against any L-p norm-bounded attacker but incurs orders of magnitude more computational and memory overhead than adversarially robust training.   We propose two novel techniques, stochastic robust approximation and dynamic mixed training, to drastically improve the efficiency of verifiably robust training without sacrificing verified robustness. We leverage two critical insights: (1) instead of over the entire training set, sound over-approximations over randomly subsampled training data points are sufficient for efficiently guiding the robust training process; and (2) We observe that the test accuracy and verifiable robustness often conflict after certain training epochs. Therefore, we use a dynamic loss function to adaptively balance them for each epoch.   We designed and implemented our techniques as part of MixTrain and evaluated it on six networks trained on three popular datasets including MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet-200. Our evaluations show that MixTrain can achieve up to $95.2\\%$ verified robust accuracy against $L_\\infty$ norm-bounded attackers while taking $15$ and $3$ times less training time than state-of-the-art verifiably robust training and adversarially robust training schemes, respectively.

Dragan, Sergey Levine","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1905.11108v3","content":"Learning to imitate expert behavior from demonstrations can be challenging, especially in environments with high-dimensional, continuous observations and unknown dynamics. Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC) suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon. Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior. Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo."},{"id":"1811.03516v2","title":"Learning from Demonstration in the Wild","authors":"Feryal Behbahani, Kyriacos Shiarlis, Xi Chen, Vitaly Kurin, Sudhanshu Kasewa, Ciprian Stirbu, Jo\u00e3o Gomes, Supratik Paul, Frans A.

We propose Video to Behaviour (ViBe), a new approach to learn models of behaviour from unlabelled raw video data of a traffic scene collected from a single, monocular, initially uncalibrated camera with ordinary resolution.

However, this method cannot distinguish between the learned reward function failing to reflect user preferences and the policy optimization process failing to optimize the learned reward. Moreover, this method can only tell us about behavior in the evaluation environment, but the reward may incentivize very different behavior in even a slightly different deployment environment. To address these problems, we introduce the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance to quantify the difference between two reward functions directly, without a policy optimization step. We prove EPIC is invariant on an equivalence class of reward functions that always induce the same optimal policy. Furthermore, we find EPIC can be efficiently approximated and is more robust than baselines to the choice of coverage distribution. Finally, we show that EPIC distance bounds the regret of optimal policies even under different transition dynamics, and we confirm empirically that it predicts policy training success.

However, by framing imitation learning as a saddle point problem, adversarial methods can suffer from unstable optimization, and convergence can only be shown for small policy updates. We address these problems by proposing a framework for non-adversarial imitation learning. The resulting algorithms are similar to their adversarial counterparts and, thus, provide insights for adversarial imitation learning methods. Most notably, we show that AIRL is an instance of our non-adversarial formulation, which enables us to greatly simplify its derivations and obtain stronger convergence guarantees. We also show that our non-adversarial formulation can be used to derive novel algorithms by presenting a method for offline imitation learning that is inspired by the recent ValueDice algorithm, but does not rely on small policy updates for convergence. In our simulated robot experiments, our offline method for non-adversarial imitation learning seems to perform best when using many updates for policy and discriminator at each iteration and outperforms behavioral cloning and ValueDice."},{"id":"2109.06160v4","title":"Augmenting Decision Making via Interactive What-If Analysis","authors":"Sneha Gathani, Madelon Hulsebos, James Gale, Peter J.

Business users often make decisions to achieve key performance indicators (KPIs) such as increasing customer retention or sales, or decreasing costs. To discover the relationship between data attributes hypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest, business users currently need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses. This involves considering multitudes of combinations and scenarios and performing slicing, dicing, and transformations on the data accordingly, e.g., analyzing customer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media channels across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of datasets combined with the cognitive limitations of humans makes it challenging to carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets. Therefore mentally performing such analyses is hard. Existing commercial tools either provide partial solutions or fail to cater to business users altogether. Here we argue for four functionalities to enable business users to interactively learn and reason about the relationships between sets of data attributes thereby facilitating data-driven decision making. We implement these functionalities in SystemD, an interactive visual data analysis system enabling business users to experiment with the data by asking what-if questions. We evaluate the system through three business use cases: marketing mix modeling, customer retention analysis, and deal closing analysis, and report on feedback from multiple business users. Users find the SystemD functionalities highly useful for quick testing and validation of their hypotheses around their KPIs of interest, addressing their unmet analysis needs.

In this paper, we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation algorithm, Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX), that extrapolates beyond a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations. When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration.

In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera.

Using a policy exploitation mechanism, experience replay and an additional loss against catastrophic forgetting, our best agent was able to achieve a mean score of 48.

However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset."},{"id":"1905.01296v3","title":"PRECOG: PREdiction Conditioned On Goals in Visual Multi-Agent Settings","authors":"Nicholas Rhinehart, Rowan McAllister, Kris Kitani, Sergey Levine","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1905.01296v3","content":"For autonomous vehicles (AVs) to behave appropriately on roads populated by human-driven vehicles, they must be able to reason about the uncertain intentions and decisions of other drivers from rich perceptual information.

We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that the use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments.

First, existing IRL methods learn reward functions from scratch, requiring large numbers of demonstrations to correctly infer the reward for each task the agent may need to perform. Second, existing methods typically assume homogeneous demonstrations for a single behavior or task, while in practice, it might be easier to collect datasets of heterogeneous but related behaviors. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable model that is capable of learning rewards from demonstrations of distinct but related tasks in an unsupervised way. Critically, our model can infer rewards for new, structurally-similar tasks from a single demonstration. Our experiments on multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art imitation and inverse reinforcement learning methods."},{"id":"2105.06791v2","title":"Agree to Disagree: When Deep Learning Models With Identical Architectures Produce Distinct Explanations","authors":"Matthew Watson, Bashar Awwad Shiekh Hasan, Noura Al Moubayed","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2105.06791v2","content":"Deep Learning of neural networks has progressively become more prominent in healthcare with models reaching, or even surpassing, expert accuracy levels. However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients' sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a low consistency: $\\approx$ 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are robust against any orthogonal changes, with explanation consistency at 94%. We conclude that current trends in model explanation are not sufficient to mitigate the risks of deploying models in real life healthcare applications."},{"id":"2011.03395v2","title":"Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning","authors":"Alexander D'Amour, Katherine Heller, Dan Moldovan, Ben Adlam, Babak Alipanahi, Alex Beutel, Christina Chen, Jonathan Deaton, Jacob Eisenstein, Matthew D.

Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain."},{"id":"1901.00064v3","title":"Impossibility and Uncertainty Theorems in AI Value Alignment (or why your AGI should not have a utility function)","authors":"Peter Eckersley","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1901.00064v3","content":"Utility functions or their equivalents (value functions, objective functions, loss functions, reward functions, preference orderings) are a central tool in most current machine learning systems. These mechanisms for defining goals and guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difficulty when there are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. Ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense.   We explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over total orders. We show that previously known impossibility theorems can be transformed into uncertainty theorems in both of those settings, and prove lower bounds on how much uncertainty is implied by the impossibility results. We close by proposing two conjectures about the relationship between uncertainty in objectives and severe unintended consequences from AI systems."},{"id":"1206.5264v1","title":"Apprenticeship Learning using Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Gradient Methods","authors":"Gergely Neu, Csaba Szepesvari","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1206.5264v1","content":"In this paper we propose a novel gradient algorithm to learn a policy from an expert's observed behavior assuming that the expert behaves optimally with respect to some unknown reward function of a Markovian Decision Problem.

The main difficulty is that the mapping from the parameters to policies is both nonsmooth and highly redundant.

Next we investigate scaling trends for several training objectives relevant to alignment, comparing imitation learning, binary discrimination, and ranked preference modeling. We find that ranked preference modeling performs much better than imitation learning, and often scales more favorably with model size.

In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains.   The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as $S($True$) + D_{\\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an $8\\times 8$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}$) in nats\/image for other resolutions.

Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."},{"id":"2107.06857v1","title":"Scalable Evaluation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Melting Pot","authors":"Joel Z.

As a result, the wider application of these techniques is currently limited by its scalability and flexibility -- these techniques often do not scale to large-scale datasets with modern deep neural networks or cannot handle loss functions which may be non-smooth, such as the 0-1 loss.

In this paper, we use theoretical and empirical analysis to better understand the importance of view selection, and argue that we should reduce the mutual information (MI) between views while keeping task-relevant information intact. To verify this hypothesis, we devise unsupervised and semi-supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI, and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy. As a by-product, we achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy on unsupervised pre-training for ImageNet classification ($73\\%$ top-1 linear readout with a ResNet-50).

These other goals include out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, prediction consistency, resilience to adversaries, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and the ability to detect anomalous inputs. However, improving performance towards these goals is often a balancing act that today's methods cannot achieve without sacrificing performance on other safety axes. For instance, adversarial training improves adversarial robustness but sharply degrades other classifier performance metrics. Similarly, strong data augmentation and regularization techniques often improve OOD robustness but harm anomaly detection, raising the question of whether a Pareto improvement on all existing safety measures is possible. To meet this challenge, we design a new data augmentation strategy utilizing the natural structural complexity of pictures such as fractals, which outperforms numerous baselines, is near Pareto-optimal, and roundly improves safety measures."},{"id":"2105.08475v1","title":"AI and Shared Prosperity","authors":"Katya Klinova, Anton Korinek","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2105.08475v1","content":"Future advances in AI that automate away human labor may have stark implications for labor markets and inequality.

While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news.   Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like `Link Found Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article; humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written disinformation.   Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake news from real, human-written, news with 73% accuracy, assuming access to a moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results further, showing that exposure bias -- and sampling strategies that alleviate its effects -- both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on. We conclude by discussing ethical issues regarding the technology, and plan to release Grover publicly, helping pave the way for better detection of neural fake news."},{"id":"2104.00739v1","title":"Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer: Workshop Recommendations","authors":"Gopal Sarma, James Koppel, Gregory Malecha, Patrick Schultz, Eric Drexler, Ramana Kumar, Cody Roux, Philip Zucker","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2104.00739v1","content":"Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMIE) was a workshop held at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in 2021 to explore the potential role of verified software in the biomedical software ecosystem.

However, in many real-world applications, task specifications are ambiguous, and can only be expressed as a belief over LTL formulas. In this paper, we introduce planning with uncertain specifications (PUnS), a novel formulation that addresses the challenge posed by non-Markovian specifications expressed as beliefs over LTL formulas. We present four criteria that capture the semantics of satisfying a belief over specifications for different applications, and analyze the qualitative implications of these criteria within a synthetic domain. We demonstrate the existence of an equivalent Markov decision process (MDP) for any instance of PUnS.

We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples.

During training, such systems are potentially dangerous, as they haven't yet learned to avoid actions that could cause serious harm. How can an AI system explore and learn without making a single mistake that harms humans or otherwise causes serious damage? For model-free reinforcement learning, having a human \"in the loop\" and ready to intervene is currently the only way to prevent all catastrophes. We formalize human intervention for RL and show how to reduce the human labor required by training a supervised learner to imitate the human's intervention decisions. We evaluate this scheme on Atari games, with a Deep RL agent being overseen by a human for four hours. When the class of catastrophes is simple, we are able to prevent all catastrophes without affecting the agent's learning (whereas an RL baseline fails due to catastrophic forgetting). However, this scheme is less successful when catastrophes are more complex: it reduces but does not eliminate catastrophes and the supervised learner fails on adversarial examples found by the agent. Extrapolating to more challenging environments, we show that our implementation would not scale (due to the infeasible amount of human labor required). We outline extensions of the scheme that are necessary if we are to train model-free agents without a single catastrophe."},{"id":"2104.06613v1","title":"Detection of Dataset Shifts in Learning-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems using Variational Autoencoder for Regression","authors":"Feiyang Cai, Ali I.

In our paper, we first provide the formal definitions for different types of dataset shifts in learning-enabled CPS. Then, we propose an approach to detect the dataset shifts effectively for regression problems. Our approach is based on the inductive conformal anomaly detection and utilizes a variational autoencoder for regression model which enables the approach to take into consideration both LEC input and output for detecting dataset shifts. Additionally, in order to improve the robustness of detection, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is incorporated into our approach. We demonstrate our approach by using an advanced emergency braking system implemented in an open-source simulator for self-driving cars.

In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures."},{"id":"2104.03113v2","title":"Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games","authors":"Andy L.

We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and show that by imposing constraints on the training environment and introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able to obtain generalized social learning policies which enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online to novel environments by taking cues from experts present in the new environment. In contrast, agents trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the transfer tasks.

While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space.

A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong. Generative models are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling the density of the input features can be used to detect novel, out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find that the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e. CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we find evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets: FashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 \/ CIFAR-100 \/ SVHN. To investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict the flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature.

Models such as deep neural networks, with high capacity through their large parameter spaces, can be used to compress the high-dimensional sensory data to lower dimensional representations. These low-dimensional representations facilitate symbol grounding, but may not guarantee that the representation would be human-interpretable. We propose a method which utilises the grouping of user-defined symbols and their corresponding sensory observations in order to align the learnt compressed latent representation with the semantic notions contained in the abstract labels.

However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED). Our experiments demonstrate that PAIRED produces a natural curriculum of increasingly complex environments, and PAIRED agents achieve higher zero-shot transfer performance when tested in highly novel environments."},{"id":"1907.00452v1","title":"Detecting Spiky Corruption in Markov Decision Processes","authors":"Jason Mancuso, Tomasz Kisielewski, David Lindner, Alok Singh","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.00452v1","content":"Current reinforcement learning methods fail if the reward function is imperfect, i.e. if the agent observes reward different from what it actually receives.

We fully characterize the regret bound of a Spiky CRMDP, and introduce an algorithm that is able to detect its corrupt states.

It is common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by plotting its \"learning curve\", that is, the decay of the error rate as a function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired accuracy.   In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that achieve the best possible rate in each case.   For concreteness, we consider in this paper only the realizable case, though analogous results are expected to extend to more general learning scenarios."},{"id":"2004.04136v4","title":"CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning","authors":"Aravind Srinivas, Michael Laskin, Pieter Abbeel","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.04136v4","content":"We present CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning.

Although this paradigm uses unlabeled data in a task-agnostic way, in contrast to common approaches to semi-supervised learning for computer vision, we show that it is surprisingly effective for semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A key ingredient of our approach is the use of big (deep and wide) networks during pretraining and fine-tuning. We find that, the fewer the labels, the more this approach (task-agnostic use of unlabeled data) benefits from a bigger network. After fine-tuning, the big network can be further improved and distilled into a much smaller one with little loss in classification accuracy by using the unlabeled examples for a second time, but in a task-specific way. The proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm can be summarized in three steps: unsupervised pretraining of a big ResNet model using SimCLRv2, supervised fine-tuning on a few labeled examples, and distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge. This procedure achieves 73.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with just 1% of the labels ($\\le$13 labeled images per class) using ResNet-50, a $10\\times$ improvement in label efficiency over the previous state-of-the-art.

By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator's internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminator's accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our method can learn such skills directly from \\emph{raw} video demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods.

Verification of networks enables us to gauge their vulnerability to such adversarial examples. We formulate verification of piecewise-linear neural networks as a mixed integer program. On a representative task of finding minimum adversarial distortions, our verifier is two to three orders of magnitude quicker than the state-of-the-art. We achieve this computational speedup via tight formulations for non-linearities, as well as a novel presolve algorithm that makes full use of all information available. The computational speedup allows us to verify properties on convolutional networks with an order of magnitude more ReLUs than networks previously verified by any complete verifier. In particular, we determine for the first time the exact adversarial accuracy of an MNIST classifier to perturbations with bounded $l_\\infty$ norm $\\epsilon=0.1$: for this classifier, we find an adversarial example for 4.38% of samples, and a certificate of robustness (to perturbations with bounded norm) for the remainder.

We address this tension by introducing a simple and effective method for improving robustness while fine-tuning: ensembling the weights of the zero-shot and fine-tuned models (WiSE-FT). Compared to standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT provides large accuracy improvements under distribution shift, while preserving high accuracy on the target distribution. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, WiSE-FT improves accuracy under distribution shift by 4 to 6 percentage points (pp) over prior work while increasing ImageNet accuracy by 1.6 pp. WiSE-FT achieves similarly large robustness gains (2 to 23 pp) on a diverse set of six further distribution shifts, and accuracy gains of 0.8 to 3.3 pp compared to standard fine-tuning on seven commonly used transfer learning datasets.

Recently, interest has grown within the broader field of AI in a generalization of open-ended evolution, here called open-ended search, wherein such questions of open-endedness are explored for advancing AI, whatever the nature of the underlying search algorithm (e.g. evolutionary or gradient-based). For example, open-ended search might design new architectures for neural networks, new reinforcement learning algorithms, or most ambitiously, aim at designing artificial general intelligence. This paper proposes that open-ended evolution and artificial life have much to contribute towards the understanding of open-ended AI, focusing here in particular on the safety of open-ended search. The idea is that AI systems are increasingly applied in the real world, often producing unintended harms in the process, which motivates the growing field of AI safety. This paper argues that open-ended AI has its own safety challenges, in particular, whether the creativity of open-ended systems can be productively and predictably controlled. This paper explains how unique safety problems manifest in open-ended search, and suggests concrete contributions and research questions to explore them. The hope is to inspire progress towards creative, useful, and safe open-ended search algorithms."},{"id":"2001.00078v1","title":"Regulatory Markets for AI Safety","authors":"Jack Clark, Gillian K.

We do not know of any general-purpose approaches in the literature to avoiding novel failure modes. Motivated by this, we define an idealized Bayesian reinforcement learner which follows a policy that maximizes the worst-case expected reward over a set of world-models. We call this agent pessimistic, since it optimizes assuming the worst case. A scalar parameter tunes the agent's pessimism by changing the size of the set of world-models taken into account. Our first main contribution is: given an assumption about the agent's model class, a sufficiently pessimistic agent does not cause \"unprecedented events\" with probability $1-\\delta$, whether or not designers know how to precisely specify those precedents they are concerned with. Since pessimism discourages exploration, at each timestep, the agent may defer to a mentor, who may be a human or some known-safe policy we would like to improve. Our other main contribution is that the agent's policy's value approaches at least that of the mentor, while the probability of deferring to the mentor goes to 0. In high-stakes environments, we might like advanced artificial agents to pursue goals cautiously, which is a non-trivial problem even if the agent were allowed arbitrary computing power; we present a formal solution."},{"id":"1907.04534v1","title":"The Role of Cooperation in Responsible AI Development","authors":"Amanda Askell, Miles Brundage, Gillian Hadfield","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.04534v1","content":"In this paper, we argue that competitive pressures could incentivize AI companies to underinvest in ensuring their systems are safe, secure, and have a positive social impact.

Translucent players may achieve significantly more efficient outcomes than opaque ones.   Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i believe that everyone else would still be rational even if $i$ were to switch strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so on.

Prior work in imitation learning typically requires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that is often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous approaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by language, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or language that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In this work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language conditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from pixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control end-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning, our method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data (i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language conditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less than 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor policy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic manipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language descriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now press the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent can follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large pretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to many out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new demonstrations.

To alleviate the burden on the reward designer, we propose an algorithm to automatically generate an auxiliary reward function that penalizes side effects. This auxiliary objective rewards the ability to complete possible future tasks, which decreases if the agent causes side effects during the current task. The future task reward can also give the agent an incentive to interfere with events in the environment that make future tasks less achievable, such as irreversible actions by other agents. To avoid this interference incentive, we introduce a baseline policy that represents a default course of action (such as doing nothing), and use it to filter out future tasks that are not achievable by default. We formally define interference incentives and show that the future task approach with a baseline policy avoids these incentives in the deterministic case. Using gridworld environments that test for side effects and interference, we show that our method avoids interference and is more effective for avoiding side effects than the common approach of penalizing irreversible actions."},{"id":"2006.09882v5","title":"Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments","authors":"Mathilde Caron, Ishan Misra, Julien Mairal, Priya Goyal, Piotr Bojanowski, Armand Joulin","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.09882v5","content":"Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods.

Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning.

To address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a collection of datasets.

However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories.

However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance.   We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well.   We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

Such data-driven optimization procedures are the only practical methods in many real-world domains where active data collection is expensive (e.g., when optimizing over proteins) or dangerous (e.g., when optimizing over aircraft designs). Typical methods for MBO that optimize the design against a learned model suffer from distributional shift: it is easy to find a design that \"fools\" the model into predicting a high value. To overcome this, we propose conservative objective models (COMs), a method that learns a model of the objective function that lower bounds the actual value of the ground-truth objective on out-of-distribution inputs, and uses it for optimization. Structurally, COMs resemble adversarial training methods used to overcome adversarial examples.

Through two kinds of simulation tests involving text and tabular data, we evaluate five explanations methods: (1) LIME, (2) Anchor, (3) Decision Boundary, (4) a Prototype model, and (5) a Composite approach that combines explanations from each method. Clear evidence of method effectiveness is found in very few cases: LIME improves simulatability in tabular classification, and our Prototype method is effective in counterfactual simulation tests.

Our results provide the first reliable and comprehensive estimates of how explanations influence simulatability across a variety of explanation methods and data domains.

How do architectural choices affect GAN learning? Answering such questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models.   In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the unit-, object-, and scene-level. We first identify a group of interpretable units that are closely related to object concepts using a segmentation-based network dissection method. Then, we quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output.

We show that pre-finetuning consistently improves performance for pretrained discriminators (e.g.~RoBERTa) and generation models (e.g.~BART) on a wide range of tasks (sentence prediction, commonsense reasoning, MRC, etc.), while also significantly improving sample efficiency during fine-tuning.

But people exhibit a wide array of irrationalities, and our goal with this work is to better understand the effect they can have on reward inference. The challenge with studying this effect is that there are many types of irrationality, with varying degrees of mathematical formalization. We thus operationalize irrationality in the language of MDPs, by altering the Bellman optimality equation, and use this framework to study how these alterations would affect inference.   We find that wrongly modeling a systematically irrational human as noisy-rational performs a lot worse than correctly capturing these biases -- so much so that it can be better to skip inference altogether and stick to the prior! More importantly, we show that an irrational human, when correctly modelled, can communicate more information about the reward than a perfectly rational human can. That is, if a robot has the correct model of a human's irrationality, it can make an even stronger inference than it ever could if the human were rational. Irrationality fundamentally helps rather than hinder reward inference, but it needs to be correctly accounted for."},{"id":"2010.11645v2","title":"Enabling certification of verification-agnostic networks via memory-efficient semidefinite programming","authors":"Sumanth Dathathri, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham, Alexey Kurakin, Aditi Raghunathan, Jonathan Uesato, Rudy Bunel, Shreya Shankar, Jacob Steinhardt, Ian Goodfellow, Percy Liang, Pushmeet Kohli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2010.11645v2","content":"Convex relaxations have emerged as a promising approach for verifying desirable properties of neural networks like robustness to adversarial perturbations. Widely used Linear Programming (LP) relaxations only work well when networks are trained to facilitate verification. This precludes applications that involve verification-agnostic networks, i.e., networks not specially trained for verification. On the other hand, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have successfully be applied to verification-agnostic networks, but do not currently scale beyond small networks due to poor time and space asymptotics. In this work, we propose a first-order dual SDP algorithm that (1) requires memory only linear in the total number of network activations, (2) only requires a fixed number of forward\/backward passes through the network per iteration. By exploiting iterative eigenvector methods, we express all solver operations in terms of forward and backward passes through the network, enabling efficient use of hardware like GPUs\/TPUs. For two verification-agnostic networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10, we significantly improve L-inf verified robust accuracy from 1% to 88% and 6% to 40% respectively.

We introduce attacks that instead {\\em reprogram} the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker---without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary---even if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the ImageNet model."},{"id":"2103.05247v2","title":"Pretrained Transformers as Universal Computation Engines","authors":"Kevin Lu, Aditya Grover, Pieter Abbeel, Igor Mordatch","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2103.05247v2","content":"We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks.

However, due to increased test-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training pipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in industrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which is relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated multi-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online distillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets about twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we have already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no benefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural networks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by encouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have made. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so they can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our second claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the exact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible.

Our work builds on COACH, moving to a setting where the agent's policy is represented by a deep neural network.

We find that, when networks are used as fixed feature extractors or fine-tuned, there is a strong correlation between ImageNet accuracy and transfer accuracy ($r = 0.99$ and $0.96$, respectively). In the former setting, we find that this relationship is very sensitive to the way in which networks are trained on ImageNet; many common forms of regularization slightly improve ImageNet accuracy but yield penultimate layer features that are much worse for transfer learning. Additionally, we find that, on two small fine-grained image classification datasets, pretraining on ImageNet provides minimal benefits, indicating the learned features from ImageNet do not transfer well to fine-grained tasks. Together, our results show that ImageNet architectures generalize well across datasets, but ImageNet features are less general than previously suggested."},{"id":"2106.05091v1","title":"PEBBLE: Feedback-Efficient Interactive Reinforcement Learning via Relabeling Experience and Unsupervised Pre-training","authors":"Kimin Lee, Laura Smith, Pieter Abbeel","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2106.05091v1","content":"Conveying complex objectives to reinforcement learning (RL) agents can often be difficult, involving meticulous design of reward functions that are sufficiently informative yet easy enough to provide.

We show that this conflict arises from the use of Drake-like equations, which implicitly assume certainty regarding highly uncertain parameters. We examine these parameters, incorporating models of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life, and show that extant scientific knowledge corresponds to uncertainties that span multiple orders of magnitude. This makes a stark difference.

In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories."},{"id":"1811.07871v1","title":"Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling: a research direction","authors":"Jan Leike, David Krueger, Tom Everitt, Miljan Martic, Vishal Maini, Shane Legg","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1811.07871v1","content":"One obstacle to applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems is the lack of suitable reward functions.

But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put this to the test -- rather than relying on assumptions about which specific bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator's planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed findings: on the one hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this benefit is dwarfed by the loss we incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner.

Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input.

We show that adversarial vulnerability increases with the gradients of the training objective when viewed as a function of the inputs. Surprisingly, vulnerability does not depend on network topology: for many standard network architectures, we prove that at initialization, the $\\ell_1$-norm of these gradients grows as the square root of the input dimension, leaving the networks increasingly vulnerable with growing image size. We empirically show that this dimension dependence persists after either usual or robust training, but gets attenuated with higher regularization."},{"id":"1808.08946v3","title":"Why Self-Attention?

CNNs and self-attentional networks can connect distant words via shorter network paths than RNNs, and it has been speculated that this improves their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, this theoretical argument has not been tested empirically, nor have alternative explanations for their strong performance been explored in-depth. We hypothesize that the strong performance of CNNs and self-attentional networks could also be due to their ability to extract semantic features from the source text, and we evaluate RNNs, CNNs and self-attention networks on two tasks: subject-verb agreement (where capturing long-range dependencies is required) and word sense disambiguation (where semantic feature extraction is required). Our experimental results show that: 1) self-attentional networks and CNNs do not outperform RNNs in modeling subject-verb agreement over long distances; 2) self-attentional networks perform distinctly better than RNNs and CNNs on word sense disambiguation."},{"id":"2004.03607v2","title":"TuringAdvice: A Generative and Dynamic Evaluation of Language Use","authors":"Rowan Zellers, Ari Holtzman, Elizabeth Clark, Lianhui Qin, Ali Farhadi, Yejin Choi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.03607v2","content":"We propose TuringAdvice, a new challenge task and dataset for language understanding models.

But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems, in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules--rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules."},{"id":"1807.10272v2","title":"Evaluating and Understanding the Robustness of Adversarial Logit Pairing","authors":"Logan Engstrom, Andrew Ilyas, Anish Athalye","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1807.10272v2","content":"We evaluate the robustness of Adversarial Logit Pairing, a recently proposed defense against adversarial examples.

We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more \"linear\" behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness."},{"id":"1806.09030v1","title":"On Adversarial Examples for Character-Level Neural Machine Translation","authors":"Javid Ebrahimi, Daniel Lowd, Dejing Dou","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1806.09030v1","content":"Evaluating on adversarial examples has become a standard procedure to measure robustness of deep learning models.

We propose two novel types of attacks which aim to remove or change a word in a translation, rather than simply break the NMT. We demonstrate that white-box adversarial examples are significantly stronger than their black-box counterparts in different attack scenarios, which show more serious vulnerabilities than previously known. In addition, after performing adversarial training, which takes only 3 times longer than regular training, we can improve the model's robustness significantly."},{"id":"1810.12715v4","title":"On the Effectiveness of Interval Bound Propagation for Training Verifiably Robust Models","authors":"Sven Gowal, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham, Robert Stanforth, Rudy Bunel, Chongli Qin, Jonathan Uesato, Relja Arandjelovic, Timothy Mann, Pushmeet Kohli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.12715v4","content":"Recent work has shown that it is possible to train deep neural networks that are provably robust to norm-bounded adversarial perturbations. Most of these methods are based on minimizing an upper bound on the worst-case loss over all possible adversarial perturbations. While these techniques show promise, they often result in difficult optimization procedures that remain hard to scale to larger networks. Through a comprehensive analysis, we show how a simple bounding technique, interval bound propagation (IBP), can be exploited to train large provably robust neural networks that beat the state-of-the-art in verified accuracy. While the upper bound computed by IBP can be quite weak for general networks, we demonstrate that an appropriate loss and clever hyper-parameter schedule allow the network to adapt such that the IBP bound is tight. This results in a fast and stable learning algorithm that outperforms more sophisticated methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. It also allows us to train the largest model to be verified beyond vacuous bounds on a downscaled version of ImageNet."},{"id":"2102.02872v2","title":"Feedback in Imitation Learning: The Three Regimes of Covariate Shift","authors":"Jonathan Spencer, Sanjiban Choudhury, Arun Venkatraman, Brian Ziebart, J.

Interactive approaches can provably address this divergence but require repeated querying of a demonstrator. Recent work identifies this divergence as stemming from a \"causal confound\" in predicting the current action, and seek to ablate causal aspects of current state using tools from causal inference. In this work, we argue instead that this divergence is simply another manifestation of covariate shift, exacerbated particularly by settings of feedback between decisions and input features. The learner often comes to rely on features that are strongly predictive of decisions, but are subject to strong covariate shift.   Our work demonstrates a broad class of problems where this shift can be mitigated, both theoretically and practically, by taking advantage of a simulator but without any further querying of expert demonstration. We analyze existing benchmarks used to test imitation learning approaches and find that these benchmarks are realizable and simple and thus insufficient for capturing the harder regimes of error compounding seen in real-world decision making problems. We find, in a surprising contrast with previous literature, but consistent with our theory, that naive behavioral cloning provides excellent results.

(1) overfits on the L-infinity metric (it's highly susceptible to L2 and L0 perturbations), (2) classifies unrecognizable images with high certainty, (3) performs not much better than simple input binarization and (4) features adversarial perturbations that make little sense to humans. These results suggest that MNIST is far from being solved in terms of adversarial robustness. We present a novel robust classification model that performs analysis by synthesis using learned class-conditional data distributions. We derive bounds on the robustness and go to great length to empirically evaluate our model using maximally effective adversarial attacks by (a) applying decision-based, score-based, gradient-based and transfer-based attacks for several different Lp norms, (b) by designing a new attack that exploits the structure of our defended model and (c) by devising a novel decision-based attack that seeks to minimize the number of perturbed pixels (L0).

We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance.

Both networks can be trained simultaneously to optimize a weighted combination of the standard data-fitting loss and a term that bounds the maximum violation of the property. Experiments show that not only is the predictor-verifier architecture able to train networks to achieve state of the art verified robustness to adversarial examples with much shorter training times (outperforming previous algorithms on small datasets like MNIST and SVHN), but it can also be scaled to produce the first known (to the best of our knowledge) verifiably robust networks for CIFAR-10."},{"id":"2201.08555v1","title":"Identifying Adversarial Attacks on Text Classifiers","authors":"Zhouhang Xie, Jonathan Brophy, Adam Noack, Wencong You, Kalyani Asthana, Carter Perkins, Sabrina Reis, Sameer Singh, Daniel Lowd","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2201.08555v1","content":"The landscape of adversarial attacks against text classifiers continues to grow, with new attacks developed every year and many of them available in standard toolkits, such as TextAttack and OpenAttack.

In settings where multiple robots act in separate environments, a single human operator can manage a fleet of robots by identifying and teleoperating one robot at any given time. The key challenge is that users have limited attention: as the number of robots increases, users lose the ability to decide which robot requires teleoperation the most. Our goal is to automate this decision, thereby enabling users to supervise more robots than their attention would normally allow for. Our insight is that we can model the user's choice of which robot to control as an approximately optimal decision that maximizes the user's utility function. We learn a model of the user's preferences from observations of the user's choices in easy settings with a few robots, and use it in challenging settings with more robots to automatically identify which robot the user would most likely choose to control, if they were able to evaluate the states of all robots at all times. We run simulation experiments and a user study with twelve participants that show our method can be used to assist users in performing a simulated navigation task.

To test this hypothesis, we propose the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) criterion for evaluating the quality of a model. In order to train models that perform well with respect to the MNI criterion, we present a new objective function, the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB), which is closely related to the Information Bottleneck (IB).

To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH, we also contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models the fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy on MATH, our results show that accuracy remains relatively low, even with enormous Transformer models. Moreover, we find that simply increasing budgets and model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong mathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue.

The survey included questions for estimating AI capabilities over the next decade, questions for forecasting five scenarios of transformative AI and questions concerning the impact of computational resources in AI research. Respondents indicated a median of 21.5% of human tasks (i.e., all tasks that humans are currently paid to do) can be feasibly automated now, and that this figure would rise to 40% in 5 years and 60% in 10 years. Median forecasts indicated a 50% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90% of current human tasks in 25 years and 99% of current human tasks in 50 years.

By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

We introduce the term auto-induced distributional shift (ADS) to describe the phenomenon of an algorithm causing a change in the distribution of its own inputs. Our goal is to ensure that machine learning systems do not leverage ADS to increase performance when doing so could be undesirable. We demonstrate that changes to the learning algorithm, such as the introduction of meta-learning, can cause hidden incentives for auto-induced distributional shift (HI-ADS) to be revealed. To address this issue, we introduce `unit tests' and a mitigation strategy for HI-ADS, as well as a toy environment for modelling real-world issues with HI-ADS in content recommendation, where we demonstrate that strong meta-learners achieve gains in performance via ADS.

To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment.

It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors, or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper, we argue that adversarial example defense papers have, to date, mostly considered abstract, toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern.

The learned transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias.

To minimize the improvement penalty, the RBI idea is to attenuate rapid policy changes of low probability actions which were less frequently sampled. This approach is shown to avoid catastrophic performance degradation and reduce regret when learning from a batch of past experience. Through a two-armed bandit with Gaussian distributed rewards example, we show that it also increases data efficiency when the optimal action has a high variance.

For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when rewards are collected through sensors), and is therefore not credible. In addition, for applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors by receiving corrupted rewards. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems with perturbed rewards, which can be approximated with a confusion matrix. We develop a robust RL framework that enables agents to learn in noisy environments where only perturbed rewards are observed. Our solution framework builds on existing RL\/DRL algorithms and firstly addresses the biased noisy reward setting without any assumptions on the true distribution (e.g., zero-mean Gaussian noise as made in previous works). The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that trained policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

The existence and frequency of such strategies may explain some of the difficulties encountered when using gradient descent in zero-sum games as, e.g., in the training of generative adversarial networks.

In this work, we propose self-supervising control on top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state. Play is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this combination generalizes well empirically---after self-supervising on unlabeled play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit retrying-till-success behaviors.

We describe the SmartChoices-interface, how it can be used in programming with minimal code changes, and demonstrate that it is an easy to use but still powerful tool by demonstrating improvements over not using ML at all on three algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches. In these three examples, we replace the commonly used heuristics with an ML model entirely encapsulated within a SmartChoice and thus requiring minimal code changes. As opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, our proposed approach does not require to drop existing implementations but seamlessly integrates into the standard software development workflow and gives full control to the software developer over how ML methods are applied. Our implementation relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn faster, we use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial function. We show how this initial function can be used to speed up and stabilize learning while providing a safety net that prevents performance to become substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical applications in real life."},{"id":"1812.03980v1","title":"Building Ethically Bounded AI","authors":"Francesca Rossi, Nicholas Mattei","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1812.03980v1","content":"The more AI agents are deployed in scenarios with possibly unexpected situations, the more they need to be flexible, adaptive, and creative in achieving the goal we have given them. Thus, a certain level of freedom to choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life, whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity. However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive those of the overall system. In this paper we define and motivate the notion of ethically-bounded AI, we describe two concrete examples, and we outline some outstanding challenges."},{"id":"1810.01014v2","title":"Bayesian Policy Optimization for Model Uncertainty","authors":"Gilwoo Lee, Brian Hou, Aditya Mandalika, Jeongseok Lee, Sanjiban Choudhury, Siddhartha S.

We formulate the problem of model uncertainty as a continuous Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), where an agent maintains a posterior distribution over latent model parameters given a history of observations and maximizes its expected long-term reward with respect to this belief distribution. Our algorithm, Bayesian Policy Optimization, builds on recent policy optimization algorithms to learn a universal policy that navigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off to maximize the Bayesian value function. To address challenges from discretizing the continuous latent parameter space, we propose a new policy network architecture that encodes the belief distribution independently from the observable state. Our method significantly outperforms algorithms that address model uncertainty without explicitly reasoning about belief distributions and is competitive with state-of-the-art Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solvers."},{"id":"2107.03374v2","title":"Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code","authors":"Mark Chen, Jerry Tworek, Heewoo Jun, Qiming Yuan, Henrique Ponde de Oliveira Pinto, Jared Kaplan, Harri Edwards, Yuri Burda, Nicholas Joseph, Greg Brockman, Alex Ray, Raul Puri, Gretchen Krueger, Michael Petrov, Heidy Khlaaf, Girish Sastry, Pamela Mishkin, Brooke Chan, Scott Gray, Nick Ryder, Mikhail Pavlov, Alethea Power, Lukasz Kaiser, Mohammad Bavarian, Clemens Winter, Philippe Tillet, Felipe Petroski Such, Dave Cummings, Matthias Plappert, Fotios Chantzis, Elizabeth Barnes, Ariel Herbert-Voss, William Hebgen Guss, Alex Nichol, Alex Paino, Nikolas Tezak, Jie Tang, Igor Babuschkin, Suchir Balaji, Shantanu Jain, William Saunders, Christopher Hesse, Andrew N.

We identify variance-limited and resolution-limited scaling behavior for both dataset and model size, for a total of four scaling regimes. The variance-limited scaling follows simply from the existence of a well-behaved infinite data or infinite width limit, while the resolution-limited regime can be explained by positing that models are effectively resolving a smooth data manifold. In the large width limit, this can be equivalently obtained from the spectrum of certain kernels, and we present evidence that large width and large dataset resolution-limited scaling exponents are related by a duality. We exhibit all four scaling regimes in the controlled setting of large random feature and pretrained models and test the predictions empirically on a range of standard architectures and datasets. We also observe several empirical relationships between datasets and scaling exponents: super-classing image tasks does not change exponents, while changing input distribution (via changing datasets or adding noise) has a strong effect. We further explore the effect of architecture aspect ratio on scaling exponents."},{"id":"2006.15191v2","title":"Is SGD a Bayesian sampler?

The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on unseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This success suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards functions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this inductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the probability $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a function $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\\mid S)$ that the DNN expresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$.   Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with $P_B(f\\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and low complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the parameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\\mid S)$), rather than a special property of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in the overparameterised regime.   While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is the first order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$, there remain second order differences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability picture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ and\/or $P_B(f\\mid S)$, can shed new light on the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as batch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance."},{"id":"2202.11233v1","title":"Retrieval Augmented Classification for Long-Tail Visual Recognition","authors":"Alexander Long, Wei Yin, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Vu Nguyen, Pulak Purkait, Ravi Garg, Alan Blair, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.11233v1","content":"We introduce Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC), a generic approach to augmenting standard image classification pipelines with an explicit retrieval module.

We demonstrate the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum games between simulated humanoid robots with proprioceptive observations, against state-of-the-art victims trained via self-play to be robust to opponents. The adversarial policies reliably win against the victims but generate seemingly random and uncoordinated behavior.

For example, highly intelligent systems may find ways to change their goals to something more easily achievable, thereby `escaping' the control of their designers. In an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued that goal preservation is a fundamental drive of any intelligent system, since a goal is more likely to be achieved if future versions of the agent strive towards the same goal. In this paper, we formalise this argument in general reinforcement learning, and explore situations where it fails. Our conclusion is that the self-modification possibility is harmless if and only if the value function of the agent anticipates the consequences of self-modifications and use the current utility function when evaluating the future."},{"id":"1811.04017v2","title":"A generic framework for privacy preserving deep learning","authors":"Theo Ryffel, Andrew Trask, Morten Dahl, Bobby Wagner, Jason Mancuso, Daniel Rueckert, Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1811.04017v2","content":"We detail a new framework for privacy preserving deep learning and discuss its assets.

This approach is compatible with both on-policy and off-policy methods. However, a caveat is that altering the distribution of initial states could change the optimal policies when searching within a restricted class of policies. To reduce this unsought learning bias, we evaluate our approach in deep reinforcement learning which benefits from the high representational capacity of deep neural networks. We instantiate three variants of our approach, each inspired by an idea in the context of experience replay.

Such inputs or states could be situations in which specific actions are necessary. Further, critical states in which a very high or a very low reward can be achieved are often interesting to understand the situational awareness of the system as they can correspond to risky states. To this end, we learn a generative model over the state space of the environment and use its latent space to optimize a target function for the state of interest. In our experiments we show that this method can generate insights for a variety of environments and reinforcement learning methods.

We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data -- in and out-of-distribution.

We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent.

In this paper, we introduce B-Pref: a benchmark specially designed for preference-based RL.

Current approaches, however, need manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method able to fit a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with the learning process of the classifiers. Synthetic and real experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond conventional cases.

In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules."},{"id":"2106.04338v1","title":"Engines of Power: Electricity, AI, and General-Purpose Military Transformations","authors":"Jeffrey Ding, Allan Dafoe","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2106.04338v1","content":"Major theories of military innovation focus on relatively narrow technological developments, such as nuclear weapons or aircraft carriers. Arguably the most profound military implications of technological change, however, come from more fundamental advances arising from general purpose technologies, such as the steam engine, electricity, and the computer. With few exceptions, political scientists have not theorized about GPTs. Drawing from the economics literature on GPTs, we distill several propositions on how and when GPTs affect military affairs. We call these effects general-purpose military transformations. In particular, we argue that the impacts of GMTs on military effectiveness are broad, delayed, and shaped by indirect productivity spillovers. Additionally, GMTs differentially advantage those militaries that can draw from a robust industrial base in the GPT. To illustrate the explanatory value of our theory, we conduct a case study of the military consequences of electricity, the prototypical GPT. Finally, we apply our findings to artificial intelligence, which will plausibly cause a profound general-purpose military transformation."},{"id":"2110.08176v2","title":"Collaborating with Humans without Human Data","authors":"DJ Strouse, Kevin R. McKee, Matt Botvinick, Edward Hughes, Richard Everett","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2110.08176v2","content":"Collaborating with humans requires rapidly adapting to their individual strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Unfortunately, most standard multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play (SP) or population play (PP), produce agents that overfit to their training partners and do not generalize well to humans. Alternatively, researchers can collect human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that model to train \"human-aware\" agents (\"behavioral cloning play\", or BCP). While such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners. Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call Fictitious Co-Play (FCP). Our experiments focus on a two-player collaborative cooking simulator that has recently been proposed as a challenge problem for coordination with humans. We find that FCP agents score significantly higher than SP, PP, and BCP when paired with novel agent and human partners. Furthermore, humans also report a strong subjective preference to partnering with FCP agents over all baselines."},{"id":"2001.03246v2","title":"The Logic of Strategic Assets: From Oil to Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Jeffrey Ding, Allan Dafoe","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2001.03246v2","content":"What resources and technologies are strategic?

We aim to improve these conversations through conceptual clarification, introducing a theory based on important rivalrous externalities for which socially optimal behavior will not be produced alone by markets or individual national security entities. We distill and theorize the most important three forms of these externalities, which involve cumulative-, infrastructure-, and dependency-strategic logics. We then employ these logics to clarify three important cases: the Avon 2 engine in the 1950s, the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the late 1980s, and contemporary conversations about artificial intelligence."},{"id":"2201.01763v2","title":"Robust Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","authors":"Bowen Shi, Wei-Ning Hsu, Abdelrahman Mohamed","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2201.01763v2","content":"Audio-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) degrades significantly in noisy environments and is particularly vulnerable to interfering speech, as the model cannot determine which speaker to transcribe.

However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the supervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of labeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR framework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art audio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available AVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by ~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in the presence of babble noise, while reducing the WER of an audio-based model by over 75% (25.8% vs. 5.8%) on average."},{"id":"1310.4546v1","title":"Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality","authors":"Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, Jeffrey Dean","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1310.4546v1","content":"The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships.

An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.

We also exhibit novel methods to promote clusterability in neural network training, and find that in multi-layer perceptrons they lead to more clusterable networks with little reduction in accuracy.

In this note, we give a simple analysis based on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm. Based on this analysis, we develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous control without any of the tricks conventionally used (such as target networks, adaptive gradient optimizers, or using multiple Q functions).

We highlight some technical results from the economics literature on incomplete contracts that may provide insights for AI alignment researchers. Our core contribution, however, is to bring to bear an insight that economists have been urged to absorb from legal scholars and other behavioral scientists: the fact that human contracting is supported by substantial amounts of external structure, such as generally available institutions (culture, law) that can supply implied terms to fill the gaps in incomplete contracts.

Through extensive experiments we show that some existing saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating process. Consequently, methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for tasks that are sensitive to either data or model, such as, finding outliers in the data, explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned, and debugging the model.

We use imitation learning to warm-start policies at each level of the hierarchy, dramatically increasing sample efficiency, followed by reinforcement learning. Independent reinforcement learning at each level of hierarchy enables sub-policies to adapt to consequences of their actions and recover from errors. Subsequent joint hierarchical training enables the master policy to adapt to the sub-policies.

However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single \"average\" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration.

We first present a formulation for learning the DR model in RL. We then derive formulas for the variance of the DR estimator in both contextual bandits and RL, such that their gradients w.r.t.~the model parameters can be estimated from the samples, and propose methods to efficiently minimize the variance.

This task-agnostic objective preserves the person's autonomy and ability to achieve any eventual state. We test our approach against assistance based on goal inference, highlighting scenarios where our method overcomes failure modes stemming from goal ambiguity or misspecification.

The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism.

Moreover, the negative effect of an OODnuisance depends on the downstream vision task. 2. Current approaches to enhance OOD robustness using strong data augmentation have only marginal effects in real-world OOD scenarios, and sometimes even reduce the OOD performance. 3.

Arjona-Medina, Michael Gillhofer, Michael Widrich, Thomas Unterthiner, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1806.07857v3","content":"We propose RUDDER, a novel reinforcement learning approach for delayed rewards in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs). In MDPs the Q-values are equal to the expected immediate reward plus the expected future rewards. The latter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to high variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even more severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future rewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the immediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the expected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to return-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when optimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via contribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a regression task at which deep learning excels. On artificial tasks with delayed rewards, RUDDER is significantly faster than MC and exponentially faster than Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), TD({\\lambda}), and reward shaping approaches. At Atari games, RUDDER on top of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline improves the scores, which is most prominent at games with delayed rewards.

Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to \"buy\" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans."},{"id":"2202.03286v1","title":"Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models","authors":"Ethan Perez, Saffron Huang, Francis Song, Trevor Cai, Roman Ring, John Aslanides, Amelia Glaese, Nat McAleese, Geoffrey Irving","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.03286v1","content":"Language Models (LMs) often cannot be deployed because of their potential to harm users in hard-to-predict ways.

We evaluate the target LM's replies to generated test questions using a classifier trained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensive replies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, from zero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases with varying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use prompt engineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of other harms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses in offensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot's own contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harms that occur over the course of a conversation.

A new architecture recently introduced by Sabour et al., referred to as a capsule networks with dynamic routing, has shown great initial results for digit recognition and small image classification. The success of capsule networks lies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for preservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the input is demonstrated by reconstructing the input from the output capsule vectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of convolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept of deconvolutional capsules. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class. The proposed convolutional-deconvolutional capsule network, called SegCaps, shows strong results for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in parameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to segment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and efficiency with other U-Net-based architectures. SegCaps is able to handle large image sizes (512 x 512) as opposed to baseline capsules (typically less than 32 x 32). The proposed SegCaps reduced the number of parameters of U-Net architecture by 95.4% while still providing a better segmentation accuracy."},{"id":"1803.05049v5","title":"Fractal AI: A fragile theory of intelligence","authors":"Sergio Hernandez Cerezo, Guillem Duran Ballester","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.05049v5","content":"Fractal AI is a theory for general artificial intelligence.

In the repository included we are presenting a new Agent, derived from the first principles of the theory, which is capable of solving Atari games several orders of magnitude more efficiently than other similar techniques, like Monte Carlo Tree Search. The code provided shows how it is now possible to beat some of the current State of The Art benchmarks on Atari games, without previous learning and using less than 1000 samples to calculate each one of the actions when standard MCTS uses 3 Million samples. Among other things, Fractal AI makes it possible to generate a huge database of top performing examples with a very little amount of computation required, transforming Reinforcement Learning into a supervised problem. The algorithm presented is capable of solving the exploration vs exploitation dilemma on both the discrete and continuous cases, while maintaining control over any aspect of the behaviour of the Agent.

Our approach encourages the learnt representations to be disentangled, which imparts a number of desirable properties: VASE can deal sensibly with ambiguous inputs, it can enhance its own representations through imagination-based exploration, and most importantly, it exhibits semantically meaningful sharing of latents between different datasets.

This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters."},{"id":"2107.11264v4","title":"Standardized Max Logits: A Simple yet Effective Approach for Identifying Unexpected Road Obstacles in Urban-Scene Segmentation","authors":"Sanghun Jung, Jungsoo Lee, Daehoon Gwak, Sungha Choi, Jaegul Choo","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.11264v4","content":"Identifying unexpected objects on roads in semantic segmentation (e.g., identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However, the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training, which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation models.

In recent years, a number of thinkers have argued that accelerating trends in computer science, cognitive science, and related disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent machines which meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future technological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many aspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully described in the context of a hypothetical \"intelligence explosion,\" in which the capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to the presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of sophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and guides the agent's actions. The \"value alignment problem\" is to specify a goal structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief article, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related disciplines aimed at characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in the mammalian class provide important conceptual foundations relevant to describing human values.

In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

Dragan, Sergey Levine","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1802.01744v2","content":"In shared autonomy, user input is combined with semi-autonomous control to achieve a common goal. The goal is often unknown ex-ante, so prior work enables agents to infer the goal from user input and assist with the task. Such methods tend to assume some combination of knowledge of the dynamics of the environment, the user's policy given their goal, and the set of possible goals the user might target, which limits their application to real-world scenarios. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for model-free shared autonomy that lifts these assumptions. We use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an end-to-end mapping from environmental observation and user input to agent action values, with task reward as the only form of supervision. This approach poses the challenge of following user commands closely enough to provide the user with real-time action feedback and thereby ensure high-quality user input, but also deviating from the user's actions when they are suboptimal. We balance these two needs by discarding actions whose values fall below some threshold, then selecting the remaining action closest to the user's input. Controlled studies with users (n = 12) and synthetic pilots playing a video game, and a pilot study with users (n = 4) flying a real quadrotor, demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to assist users with real-time control tasks in which the agent cannot directly access the user's private information through observations, but receives a reward signal and user input that both depend on the user's intent. The agent learns to assist the user without access to this private information, implicitly inferring it from the user's input. This paper is a proof of concept that illustrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning to enable flexible and practical assistive systems."},{"id":"1803.05859v4","title":"Neural Network Quine","authors":"Oscar Chang, Hod Lipson","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.05859v4","content":"Self-replication is a key aspect of biological life that has been largely overlooked in Artificial Intelligence systems.

We also describe a method we call regeneration to train the network without explicit optimization, by injecting the network with predictions of its own parameters. The best solution for a self-replicating network was found by alternating between regeneration and optimization steps. Finally, we describe a design for a self-replicating neural network that can solve an auxiliary task such as MNIST image classification. We observe that there is a trade-off between the network's ability to classify images and its ability to replicate, but training is biased towards increasing its specialization at image classification at the expense of replication. This is analogous to the trade-off between reproduction and other tasks observed in nature.

As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits.

Although machine learning models can sometimes achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine learning models affects human performance and human agency.   In this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels (>20% relative improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown, explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff."},{"id":"1604.00545v3","title":"The AGI Containment Problem","authors":"James Babcock, Janos Kramar, Roman Yampolskiy","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1604.00545v3","content":"There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and motivations future AGIs will have.

So far, the work on safely interruptible agents has assumed a perfect perception of the agent about its environment (no adversary), and therefore implicitly set the second probability to zero, by explicitly seeking a value of one for the first probability. We show that (1) agents can be made both interruptible and adversary-resilient, and (2) the interruptibility can be made safe in the sense that the agent itself will not seek to avoid it. We also solve the problem that arises when the agent does not go completely greedy, i.e. issues with safe exploration in the limit. Resilience to perturbed perception, safe exploration in the limit, and safe interruptibility are the three pillars of what we call \\emph{virtuously safe reinforcement learning}."},{"id":"1912.00782v2","title":"The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies","authors":"Ehsan Toreini, Mhairi Aitken, Kovila Coopamootoo, Karen Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1912.00782v2","content":"To build AI-based systems that users and the public can justifiably trust one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust put in these services.

We consider four categories of machine learning technologies, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these possess the required qualities. Trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss technological needs for trust in different stages of the life cycle.

Brown, Scott Niekum","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1912.04472v1","content":"Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods are ideal for safe imitation learning, as they allow a learning agent to reason about reward uncertainty and the safety of a learned policy. However, Bayesian IRL is computationally intractable for high-dimensional problems because each sample from the posterior requires solving an entire Markov Decision Process (MDP). While there exist non-Bayesian deep IRL methods, these methods typically infer point estimates of reward functions, precluding rigorous safety and uncertainty analysis. We propose Bayesian Reward Extrapolation (B-REX), a highly efficient, preference-based Bayesian reward learning algorithm that scales to high-dimensional, visual control tasks. Our approach uses successor feature representations and preferences over demonstrations to efficiently generate samples from the posterior distribution over the demonstrator's reward function without requiring an MDP solver. Using samples from the posterior, we demonstrate how to calculate high-confidence bounds on policy performance in the imitation learning setting, in which the ground-truth reward function is unknown. We evaluate our proposed approach on the task of learning to play Atari games via imitation learning from pixel inputs, with no access to the game score. We demonstrate that B-REX learns imitation policies that are competitive with a state-of-the-art deep imitation learning method that only learns a point estimate of the reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that samples from the posterior generated via B-REX can be used to compute high-confidence performance bounds for a variety of evaluation policies. We show that high-confidence performance bounds are useful for accurately ranking different evaluation policies when the reward function is unknown. We also demonstrate that high-confidence performance bounds may be useful for detecting reward hacking."},{"id":"1912.01683v9","title":"Optimal Policies Tend to Seek Power","authors":"Alexander Matt Turner, Logan Smith, Rohin Shah, Andrew Critch, Prasad Tadepalli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1912.01683v9","content":"Some researchers speculate that intelligent reinforcement learning (RL) agents would be incentivized to seek resources and power in pursuit of their objectives. Other researchers point out that RL agents need not have human-like power-seeking instincts. To clarify this discussion, we develop the first formal theory of the statistical tendencies of optimal policies. In the context of Markov decision processes, we prove that certain environmental symmetries are sufficient for optimal policies to tend to seek power over the environment. These symmetries exist in many environments in which the agent can be shut down or destroyed. We prove that in these environments, most reward functions make it optimal to seek power by keeping a range of options available and, when maximizing average reward, by navigating towards larger sets of potential terminal states."},{"id":"1802.05666v2","title":"Adversarial Risk and the Dangers of Evaluating Against Weak Attacks","authors":"Jonathan Uesato, Brendan O'Donoghue, Aaron van den Oord, Pushmeet Kohli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1802.05666v2","content":"This paper investigates recently proposed approaches for defending against adversarial examples and evaluating adversarial robustness. We motivate 'adversarial risk' as an objective for achieving models robust to worst-case inputs. We then frame commonly used attacks and evaluation metrics as defining a tractable surrogate objective to the true adversarial risk. This suggests that models may optimize this surrogate rather than the true adversarial risk. We formalize this notion as 'obscurity to an adversary,' and develop tools and heuristics for identifying obscured models and designing transparent models. We demonstrate that this is a significant problem in practice by repurposing gradient-free optimization techniques into adversarial attacks, which we use to decrease the accuracy of several recently proposed defenses to near zero. Our hope is that our formulations and results will help researchers to develop more powerful defenses."},{"id":"1903.11680v3","title":"Gradient Descent with Early Stopping is Provably Robust to Label Noise for Overparameterized Neural Networks","authors":"Mingchen Li, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Samet Oymak","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1903.11680v3","content":"Modern neural networks are typically trained in an over-parameterized regime where the parameters of the model far exceed the size of the training data. Such neural networks in principle have the capacity to (over)fit any set of labels including pure noise. Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural network models trained via first-order methods continue to predict well on yet unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise\/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent overfitting."},{"id":"1906.03973v2","title":"E-LPIPS: Robust Perceptual Image Similarity via Random Transformation Ensembles","authors":"Markus Kettunen, Erik H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen, Jaakko Lehtinen","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.03973v2","content":"It has been recently shown that the hidden variables of convolutional neural networks make for an efficient perceptual similarity metric that accurately predicts human judgment on relative image similarity assessment.

Finally, we study the geometry imposed by our our novel self-ensembled metric (E-LPIPS) on the space of natural images.

With the environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), most of the existing IL algorithms are contingent on the availability of expert demonstrations in the same MDP as the one in which a new imitator policy is to be learned. This is uncharacteristic of many real-life scenarios where discrepancies between the expert and the imitator MDPs are common, especially in the transition dynamics function. Furthermore, obtaining expert actions may be costly or infeasible, making the recent trend towards state-only IL (where expert demonstrations constitute only states or observations) ever so promising. Building on recent adversarial imitation approaches that are motivated by the idea of divergence minimization, we present a new state-only IL algorithm in this paper. It divides the overall optimization objective into two subproblems by introducing an indirection step and solves the subproblems iteratively. We show that our algorithm is particularly effective when there is a transition dynamics mismatch between the expert and imitator MDPs, while the baseline IL methods suffer from performance degradation. To analyze this, we construct several interesting MDPs by modifying the configuration parameters for the MuJoCo locomotion tasks from OpenAI Gym."},{"id":"2112.10190v1","title":"Demanding and Designing Aligned Cognitive Architectures","authors":"Koen Holtman","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2112.10190v1","content":"With AI systems becoming more powerful and pervasive, there is increasing debate about keeping their actions aligned with the broader goals and needs of humanity.

We make this technical topic more accessible by using the framing of cognitive architectures. The second issue is to move beyond an analytical framing that treats useful intelligence as being reward maximization only. To support this move, we define several AI cognitive architectures that combine reward maximization with other technical elements designed to improve alignment. The third issue is how stakeholders should calibrate their interactions with modern machine learning researchers. We consider how current fashions in machine learning create a narrative pull that participants in technical and policy discussions should be aware of, so that they can compensate for it.

It is important to keep in mind that for AI, meeting the expectations of this social contract is critical, because recklessly driving the adoption and implementation of unsafe, irresponsible, or unethical AI systems may trigger serious backlash against industry and academia involved which could take decades to resolve, if not actually seriously harm society. For the purpose of this paper, we consider that a social contract arises when there is sufficient consensus within society to adopt and implement this new technology.

Humans naturally infer other agents' beliefs and desires by reasoning about their observable behavior in a way that resembles inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Thus, robots can convey their beliefs and desires by providing demonstrations that are informative for a human's IRL. An informative demonstration is one that differs strongly from the learner's expectations of what the robot will do given their current understanding of the robot's decision making. However, standard IRL does not model the learner's existing expectations, and thus cannot do this counterfactual reasoning. We propose to incorporate the learner's current understanding of the robot's decision making into our model of human IRL, so that our robot can select demonstrations that maximize the human's understanding. We also propose a novel measure for estimating the difficulty for a human to predict instances of a robot's behavior in unseen environments. A user study finds that our test difficulty measure correlates well with human performance and confidence. Interestingly, considering human beliefs and counterfactuals when selecting demonstrations decreases human performance on easy tests, but increases performance on difficult tests, providing insight on how to best utilize such models."},{"id":"1907.13275v1","title":"Towards a Theory of Intentions for Human-Robot Collaboration","authors":"Rocio Gomez, Mohan Sridharan, Heather Riley","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.13275v1","content":"The architecture described in this paper encodes a theory of intentions based on the the key principles of non-procrastination, persistence, and automatically limiting reasoning to relevant knowledge and observations. The architecture reasons with transition diagrams of any given domain at two different resolutions, with the fine-resolution description defined as a refinement of, and hence tightly-coupled to, a coarse-resolution description. Non-monotonic logical reasoning with the coarse-resolution description computes an activity (i.e., plan) comprising abstract actions for any given goal. Each abstract action is implemented as a sequence of concrete actions by automatically zooming to and reasoning with the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to the current coarse-resolution transition and the goal. Each concrete action in this sequence is executed using probabilistic models of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, and the corresponding fine-resolution outcomes are used to infer coarse-resolution observations that are added to the coarse-resolution history. The architecture's capabilities are evaluated in the context of a simulated robot assisting humans in an office domain, on a physical robot (Baxter) manipulating tabletop objects, and on a wheeled robot (Turtlebot) moving objects to particular places or people.

By exploiting these intermediate truth values, we can allow agents to adopt a more vague interpretation of underlying concepts in order to weaken their beliefs and reduce the levels of inconsistency, so as to achieve consensus. We consider a consensus combination operation which results in agents adopting the borderline truth value as a shared viewpoint if they are in direct conflict. Simulation experiments are presented which show that applying this operator to agents chosen at random (subject to a consistency threshold) from a population, with initially diverse opinions, results in convergence to a smaller set of more precise shared beliefs. Furthermore, if the choice of agents for combination is dependent on the payoff of their beliefs, this acting as a proxy for performance or usefulness, then the system converges to beliefs which, on average, have higher payoff."},{"id":"2203.11677v1","title":"Robust Action Gap Increasing with Clipped Advantage Learning","authors":"Zhe Zhang, Yaozhong Gan, Xiaoyang Tan","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2203.11677v1","content":"Advantage Learning (AL) seeks to increase the action gap between the optimal action and its competitors, so as to improve the robustness to estimation errors.

The idea of this paper is to sharpen and deepen this premise by proposing a perspective on the decision maker that is substantive and widely held across psychology, artificial intelligence, economics, control theory, and neuroscience, which I call the \"common model of the intelligent agent\". The common model does not include anything specific to any organism, world, or application domain. The common model does include aspects of the decision maker's interaction with its world (there must be input and output, and a goal) and internal components of the decision maker (for perception, decision-making, internal evaluation, and a world model). I identify these aspects and components, note that they are given different names in different disciplines but refer essentially to the same ideas, and discuss the challenges and benefits of devising a neutral terminology that can be used across disciplines. It is time to recognize and build on the convergence of multiple diverse disciplines on a substantive common model of the intelligent agent."},{"id":"2101.11832v2","title":"Making Responsible AI the Norm rather than the Exception","authors":"Abhishek Gupta","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2101.11832v2","content":"This report prepared by the Montreal AI Ethics Institute provides recommendations in response to the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) Key Considerations for Responsible Development and Fielding of Artificial Intelligence document.

After providing some overarching comments on the document from the NSCAI, the report dives into the primary contribution of an actionable framework to help operationalize the ideas presented in the document from the NSCAI. The framework consists of: (1) a learning, knowledge, and information exchange (LKIE), (2) the Three Ways of Responsible AI, (3) an empirically-driven risk-prioritization matrix, and (4) achieving the right level of complexity. All components reinforce each other to move from principles to practice in service of making Responsible AI the norm rather than the exception."},{"id":"2107.14052v1","title":"The Role of Social Movements, Coalitions, and Workers in Resisting Harmful Artificial Intelligence and Contributing to the Development of Responsible AI","authors":"Susan von Struensee","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.14052v1","content":"There is mounting public concern over the influence that AI based systems has in our society.

Santos, Tom Lenaerts","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.12393v2","content":"Rapid technological advancements in AI as well as the growing deployment of intelligent technologies in new application domains are currently driving the competition between businesses, nations and regions. This race for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that may lead to negative consequences, in particular, when ethical and safety procedures are underestimated or even ignored. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements. As there is no easy access to data describing this AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its dynamics, allowing for the identification of when, how and which procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which AI supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this supremacy can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that blindly imposing regulations may not have anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short term situation, certain conditions require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance to safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for AI, a clear understanding about the time-scale of the race is required."},{"id":"2111.13786v1","title":"Learning from learning machines: a new generation of AI technology to meet the needs of science","authors":"Luca Pion-Tonachini, Kristofer Bouchard, Hector Garcia Martin, Sean Peisert, W.

Tool support for the localization and repair of faults within knowledge bases of such systems can therefore be essential for their practical success. Correspondingly, a number of knowledge base debugging approaches, in particular for ontology-based systems, were proposed throughout recent years. Query-based debugging is a comparably recent interactive approach that localizes the true cause of an observed problem by asking knowledge engineers a series of questions. Concrete implementations of this approach exist, such as the OntoDebug plug-in for the ontology editor Prot\\'eg\\'e.   To validate that a newly proposed method is favorable over an existing one, researchers often rely on simulation-based comparisons. Such an evaluation approach however has certain limitations and often cannot fully inform us about a method's true usefulness. We therefore conducted different user studies to assess the practical value of query-based ontology debugging. One main insight from the studies is that the considered interactive approach is indeed more efficient than an alternative algorithmic debugging based on test cases. We also observed that users frequently made errors in the process, which highlights the importance of a careful design of the queries that users need to answer."},{"id":"2105.03414v1","title":"Using reinforcement learning to design an AI assistantfor a satisfying co-op experience","authors":"Ajay Krishnan, Niranj Jyothish, Xun Jia","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2105.03414v1","content":"In this project, we designed an intelligent assistant player for the single-player game Space Invaders with the aim to provide a satisfying co-op experience.

The goal in this paper is to automate $\\mathcal{DDE}$. We briefly present $\\mathcal{DDE}$, and use a first-order modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to simulate successfully scenarios that have been used to test for the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes: One can use it to build $\\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant autonomous systems from scratch, or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is $\\mathcal{DDE}$-compliant, by applying a $\\mathcal{DDE}$ layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the $\\mathcal{DDE}$ layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by presenting initial work on how one can apply our $\\mathcal{DDE}$ layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model.This is preliminary work to illustrate the feasibility of the second mode, and we hope that our initial sketches can be useful for other researchers in incorporating DDE in their own frameworks."},{"id":"1910.04527v1","title":"The Quest for Interpretable and Responsible Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Vaishak Belle","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.04527v1","content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities to improve private and public life.

Yet blindly regulating an innovation process that is not well understood, may stifle this process and reduce benefits that society may gain from the generated technology, even under the best intentions. In this paper, starting from a baseline model that captures the fundamental dynamics of a race for domain supremacy using AI technology, we demonstrate how socially unwanted outcomes may be produced when sanctioning is applied unconditionally to risk-taking, i.e. potentially unsafe, behaviours. As an alternative to resolve the detrimental effect of over-regulation, we propose a voluntary commitment approach wherein technologists have the freedom of choice between independently pursuing their course of actions or establishing binding agreements to act safely, with sanctioning of those that do not abide to what they pledged. Overall, this work reveals for the first time how voluntary commitments, with sanctions either by peers or an institution, leads to socially beneficial outcomes in all scenarios envisageable in a short-term race towards domain supremacy through AI technology. These results are directly relevant for the design of governance and regulatory policies that aim to ensure an ethical and responsible AI technology development process."},{"id":"1907.10508v1","title":"A system of different layers of abstraction for artificial intelligence","authors":"Alexander Serb, Themistoklis Prodromakis","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.10508v1","content":"The field of artificial intelligence (AI) represents an enormous endeavour of humankind that is currently transforming our societies down to their very foundations. Its task, building truly intelligent systems, is underpinned by a vast array of subfields ranging from the development of new electronic components to mathematical formulations of highly abstract and complex reasoning. This breadth of subfields renders it often difficult to understand how they all fit together into a bigger picture and hides the multi-faceted, multi-layered conceptual structure that in a sense can be said to be what AI truly is. In this perspective we propose a system of five levels\/layers of abstraction that underpin many AI implementations. We further posit that each layer is subject to a complexity-performance trade-off whilst different layers are interlocked with one another in a control-complexity trade-off. This overview provides a conceptual map that can help to identify how and where innovation should be targeted in order to achieve different levels of functionality, assure them for safety, optimise performance under various operating constraints and map the opportunity space for social and economic exploitation."},{"id":"1209.3734v1","title":"RIO: Minimizing User Interaction in Ontology Debugging","authors":"Patrick Rodler, Kostyantyn Shchekotykhin, Philipp Fleiss, Gerhard Friedrich","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1209.3734v1","content":"Efficient ontology debugging is a cornerstone for many activities in the context of the Semantic Web, especially when automatic tools produce (parts of) ontologies such as in the field of ontology matching. The best currently known interactive debugging systems rely upon some meta information in terms of fault probabilities, which can speed up the debugging procedure in the good case, but can also have negative impact on the performance in the bad case. The problem is that assessment of the meta information is only possible a-posteriori. Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk of suboptimal interactive diagnoses discrimination. As an alternative, one might prefer to rely on a tool which pursues a no-risk strategy. In this case, however, possibly well-chosen meta information cannot be exploited, resulting again in inefficient debugging actions. In this work we present a reinforcement learning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the performance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta information. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where reliable a-priori fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using problematic ontologies in the field of ontology matching, we show that the proposed risk-aware query strategy outperforms both active learning approaches and no-risk strategies on average in terms of required amount of user interaction."},{"id":"1401.3825v1","title":"Reasoning About the Transfer of Control","authors":"Wiebe van der Hoek, Dirk Walther, Michael Wooldridge","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1401.3825v1","content":"We present DCL-PC: a logic for reasoning about how the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents are altered by transferring control from one agent to another. The logical foundation of DCL-PC is CL-PC, a logic for reasoning about cooperation in which the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents stem from a distribution of atomic Boolean variables to individual agents -- the choices available to a coalition correspond to assignments to the variables the coalition controls. The basic modal constructs of DCL-PC are of the form coalition C can cooperate to bring about phi. DCL-PC extends CL-PC with dynamic logic modalities in which atomic programs are of the form agent i gives control of variable p to agent j; as usual in dynamic logic, these atomic programs may be combined using sequence, iteration, choice, and test operators to form complex programs. By combining such dynamic transfer programs with cooperation modalities, it becomes possible to reason about how the power of agents and coalitions is affected by the transfer of control. We give two alternative semantics for the logic: a direct semantics, in which we capture the distributions of Boolean variables to agents; and a more conventional Kripke semantics. We prove that these semantics are equivalent, and then present an axiomatization for the logic. We investigate the computational complexity of model checking and satisfiability for DCL-PC, and show that both problems are PSPACE-complete (and hence no worse than the underlying logic CL-PC). Finally, we investigate the characterisation of control in DCL-PC. We distinguish between first-order control -- the ability of an agent or coalition to control some state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under the control of the agent or coalition -- and second-order control -- the ability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by transferring variables to other agents. We give a logical characterisation of second-order control."},{"id":"1304.1516v1","title":"Inference Policies","authors":"Paul E.

In the test phase, the AI agent has to interact with a user of unknown type. Our approach to designing a robust AI agent relies on observing the user's actions to make inferences about the user's type and adapting its policy to facilitate efficient cooperation. We show that without being adaptive, an AI agent can end up performing arbitrarily bad in the test phase. We develop two algorithms for computing policies that automatically adapt to the user in the test phase.

Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly, a better understanding of our own minds.   But not all types of AI are human-like. In fact, many of the most powerful systems are very different from humans. So an excessive focus on developing and deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Furthermore, augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and policymakers."},{"id":"2109.08273v1","title":"ThriftyDAgger: Budget-Aware Novelty and Risk Gating for Interactive Imitation Learning","authors":"Ryan Hoque, Ashwin Balakrishna, Ellen Novoseller, Albert Wilcox, Daniel S.

This paper presents ThriftyDAgger, an algorithm for actively querying a human supervisor given a desired budget of human interventions. ThriftyDAgger uses a learned switching policy to solicit interventions only at states that are sufficiently (1) novel, where the robot policy has no reference behavior to imitate, or (2) risky, where the robot has low confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce a novel metric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in simulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that ThriftyDAgger's intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor burden more effectively than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be applied at execution time, where it achieves a 100% success rate on both the simulation and physical tasks. A user study (N=10) in which users control a three-robot fleet while also performing a concentration task suggests that ThriftyDAgger increases human and robot performance by 58% and 80% respectively compared to the next best algorithm while reducing supervisor burden."},{"id":"2010.15578v1","title":"Exploring the Nuances of Designing (with\/for) Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Niya Stoimenova, Rebecca Price","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2010.15578v1","content":"Solutions relying on artificial intelligence are devised to predict data patterns and answer questions that are clearly defined, involve an enumerable set of solutions, clear rules, and inherently binary decision mechanisms.

Since each of them yields a different outcome, a key problem is to decide which one to use in which circumstances. Specifically, we consider this question for a model in which the agents have time constraints (in the form of both deadlines and discount factors) and information uncertainty (in that the agents do not know the opponents utility function). For this model, we consider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and determine equilibria for each case for each procedure. In so doing, we show that the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then go on to show that, although the package deal may be computationally more complex than the other two procedures, it generates Pareto optimal outcomes (unlike the other two), it has similar earliest and latest possible times of agreement to the simultaneous procedure (which is better than the sequential procedure), and that it (like the other two procedures) generates a unique outcome only under certain conditions (which we define)."},{"id":"2203.15414v1","title":"Quality Assurance of Generative Dialog Models in an Evolving Conversational Agent Used for Swedish Language Practice","authors":"Markus Borg, Johan Bengtsson, Harald \u00d6sterling, Alexander Hagelborn, Isabella Gagner, Piotr Tomaszewski","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2203.15414v1","content":"Due to the migration megatrend, efficient and effective second-language acquisition is vital.

The successful deployment of such systems hinges on the availability of reliable inter-agent communication. However, many sources of potential disruption to communication exist in practice, such as radio interference, hardware failure, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we develop joint policies for cooperative multiagent systems that are robust to potential losses in communication. More specifically, we develop joint policies for cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. First, we propose an algorithm for the decentralized execution of joint policies during periods of communication loss. Next, we use the total correlation of the state-action process induced by a joint policy as a measure of the intrinsic dependencies between the agents. We then use this measure to lower-bound the performance of a joint policy when communication is lost. Finally, we present an algorithm that maximizes a proxy to this lower bound in order to synthesize minimum-dependency joint policies that are robust to communication loss. Numerical experiments show that the proposed minimum-dependency policies require minimal coordination between the agents while incurring little to no loss in performance; the total correlation value of the synthesized policy is one fifth of the total correlation value of the baseline policy which does not take potential communication losses into account. As a result, the performance of the minimum-dependency policies remains consistently high regardless of whether or not communication is available. By contrast, the performance of the baseline policy decreases by twenty percent when communication is lost."},{"id":"2107.04303v2","title":"Integrating Planning, Execution and Monitoring in the presence of Open World Novelties: Case Study of an Open World Monopoly Solver","authors":"Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Utkarsh Soni, Tung Thai, Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Matthias Scheutz, Subbarao Kambhampati","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.04303v2","content":"The game of monopoly is an adversarial multi-agent domain where there is no fixed goal other than to be the last player solvent, There are useful subgoals like monopolizing sets of properties, and developing them.

Santos","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2010.00403v1","content":"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going through a period of great expectations, introducing a certain level of anxiety in research, business and also policy. This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to \"win\". Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in {the latter} regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the nature and kinds of regulatory actions most suitable to improve safety compliance in the contexts of both smooth and sudden technological shifts."},{"id":"1809.10283v2","title":"Adding Neural Network Controllers to Behavior Trees without Destroying Performance Guarantees","authors":"Christopher Iliffe Sprague, Petter \u00d6gren","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1809.10283v2","content":"In this paper, we show how Behavior Trees that have performance guarantees, in terms of safety and goal convergence, can be extended with components that were designed using machine learning, without destroying those performance guarantees.   Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning or learning from demonstration can be very appealing to AI designers that want efficient and realistic behaviors in their agents. However, those algorithms seldom provide guarantees for solving the given task in all different situations while keeping the agent safe. Instead, such guarantees are often easier to find for manually designed model based approaches. In this paper we exploit the modularity of Behavior trees to extend a given design with an efficient, but possibly unreliable, machine learning component in a way that preserves the guarantees. The approach is illustrated with an inverted pendulum example."},{"id":"2110.09240v1","title":"Value alignment: a formal approach","authors":"Carles Sierra, Nardine Osman, Pablo Noriega, Jordi Sabater-Mir, Antoni Perell\u00f3","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2110.09240v1","content":"principles that should govern autonomous AI systems.

This problem has been previously formalized by multiple frameworks one of which is the interactive dynamic influence diagram (I-DID), which generalizes the well-known influence diagram to the multiagent setting. I-DIDs are graphical models and may be used to compute the policy of an agent given its belief over the physical state and others models, which changes as the agent acts and observes in the multiagent setting.   As we may expect, solving I-DIDs is computationally hard. This is predominantly due to the large space of candidate models ascribed to the other agents and its exponential growth over time. We present two methods for reducing the size of the model space and stemming its exponential growth. Both these methods involve aggregating individual models into equivalence classes. Our first method groups together behaviorally equivalent models and selects only those models for updating which will result in predictive behaviors that are distinct from others in the updated model space. The second method further compacts the model space by focusing on portions of the behavioral predictions. Specifically, we cluster actionally equivalent models that prescribe identical actions at a single time step. Exactly identifying the equivalences would require us to solve all models in the initial set. We avoid this by selectively solving some of the models, thereby introducing an approximation. We discuss the error introduced by the approximation, and empirically demonstrate the improved efficiency in solving I-DIDs due to the equivalences."},{"id":"1301.6713v1","title":"Choosing Among Interpretations of Probability","authors":"Henry E.

Almost any method of uncertainty management will have the property that in the long run it will deliver numbers approaching the relative frequency of the kinds of events at issue. To find a measure that will provide a meaningful evaluation of these treatments of uncertainty, we must look, not at the long run, but at the short or intermediate run. Our project attempts to develop such a measure in terms of short or intermediate length performance. We represent the effects of practical choices by the outcomes of bets offered to agents characterized by two uncertainty management approaches: the subjective Bayesian approach and the Classical confidence interval approach.

However, many significant research challenges remain to be addressed for the AI approach, including the lack of high-quality training data due to privacy and resources constraints in this data-driven approach. To address these challenges, we need to take a look at humans' cooperation in a larger time scale. To facilitate cooperation in modern history, we have built three major technologies: ``grid of transportation\", ``grid of energy\", and ``the Internet of information\". In this paper, we argue that the next cooperation paradigm could be the ``Internet of intelligence (Intelligence-Net)\", where intelligence can be easily obtained like energy and information, enabled by the recent advances in blockchain technology.

In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance."},{"id":"1304.2751v1","title":"Integrating Logical and Probabilistic Reasoning for Decision Making","authors":"John S.

This article distinguishes two types of alignment problems depending on whose goals we consider, and analyzes the different solutions necessitated by each. The direct alignment problem considers whether an AI system accomplishes the goals of the entity operating it. In contrast, the social alignment problem considers the effects of an AI system on larger groups or on society more broadly. In particular, it also considers whether the system imposes externalities on others. Whereas solutions to the direct alignment problem center around more robust implementation, social alignment problems typically arise because of conflicts between individual and group-level goals, elevating the importance of AI governance to mediate such conflicts. Addressing the social alignment problem requires both enforcing existing norms on their developers and operators and designing new norms that apply directly to AI systems."},{"id":"2010.02278v2","title":"Reasons People Want Explanations After Unrecoverable Pre-Handover Failures","authors":"Zhao Han, Holly A.

This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent, then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter. This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can then design even more intelligent machines, and so on)."},{"id":"2102.00834v1","title":"Counterfactual Planning in AGI Systems","authors":"Koen Holtman","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2102.00834v1","content":"We present counterfactual planning as a design approach for creating a range of safety mechanisms that can be applied in hypothetical future AI systems which have Artificial General Intelligence.

A counterfactual planning agent determines the action that best maximizes expected utility in this counterfactual planning world, and then performs the same action in the real world.   We use counterfactual planning to construct an AGI agent emergency stop button, and a safety interlock that will automatically stop the agent before it undergoes an intelligence explosion. We also construct an agent with an input terminal that can be used by humans to iteratively improve the agent's reward function, where the incentive for the agent to manipulate this improvement process is suppressed. As an example of counterfactual planning in a non-agent AGI system, we construct a counterfactual oracle.   As a design approach, counterfactual planning is built around the use of a graphical notation for defining mathematical counterfactuals. This two-diagram notation also provides a compact and readable language for reasoning about the complex types of self-referencing and indirect representation which are typically present inside machine learning agents."},{"id":"2108.09404v2","title":"Safe Transformative AI via a Windfall Clause","authors":"Paolo Bova, Jonas Emanuel M\u00fcller, Benjamin Harack","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2108.09404v2","content":"Society could soon see transformative artificial intelligence (TAI).

However, a key challenge for a Windfall Clause is that firms must have reason to join one. Firms must also believe these commitments are credible. We extend a model of TAI competition with a Windfall Clause to show how firms and policymakers can design a Windfall Clause which overcomes these challenges. Encouragingly, firms benefit from joining a Windfall Clause under a wide range of scenarios. We also find that firms join the Windfall Clause more often when the competition is more dangerous. Even when firms learn each other's capabilities, firms rarely wish to withdraw their support for the Windfall Clause. These three findings strengthen the case for using a Windfall Clause to promote the safe development of TAI."},{"id":"1611.03372v1","title":"A stochastically verifiable autonomous control architecture with reasoning","authors":"Paolo Izzo, Hongyang Qu, Sandor M.

Their characterization holds in a rich structure called a complete structure, where all types are possible. In earlier work, we gave a characterization of iterated admissibility using an \"all I know\" operator, that captures the intuition that \"all the agent knows\" is that agents satisfy the appropriate rationality assumptions. That characterization did not need complete structures and used probability structures, not LPSs. However, that characterization did not deal with Samuelson's conceptual concern regarding IA, namely, that at higher levels, players do not consider possible strategies that were used to justify their choice of strategy at lower levels. In this paper, we give a characterization of IA using the all I know operator that does deal with Samuelson's concern. However, it uses LPSs. We then show how to modify the characterization using notions of \"approximate belief\" and \"approximately all I know\" so as to deal with Samuelson's concern while still working with probability structures."},{"id":"2107.01407v2","title":"Optimality Inductive Biases and Agnostic Guidelines for Offline Reinforcement Learning","authors":"Lionel Blond\u00e9, Alexandros Kalousis, St\u00e9phane Marchand-Maillet","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.01407v2","content":"The performance of state-of-the-art offline RL methods varies widely over the spectrum of dataset qualities, ranging from far-from-optimal random data to close-to-optimal expert demonstrations. We re-implement these methods to test their reproducibility, and show that when a given method outperforms the others on one end of the spectrum, it never does on the other end. This prevents us from naming a victor across the board. We attribute the asymmetry to the amount of inductive bias injected into the agent to entice it to posit that the behavior underlying the offline dataset is optimal for the task. Our investigations confirm that careless injections of such optimality inductive biases make dominant agents subpar as soon as the offline policy is sub-optimal. To bridge this gap, we generalize importance-weighted regression methods that have proved the most versatile across the spectrum of dataset grades into a modular framework that allows for the design of methods that align with how much we know about the dataset. This modularity enables qualitatively different injections of optimality inductive biases. We show that certain orchestrations strike the right balance, improving the return on one end of the spectrum without harming it on the other end. While the formulation of guidelines for the design of an offline method reduces to aligning the amount of optimality bias to inject with what we know about the quality of the data, the design of an agnostic method for which we need not know the quality of the data beforehand is more nuanced. Only our framework allowed us to design a method that performed well across the spectrum while remaining modular if more information about the quality of the data ever becomes available."},{"id":"1705.09349v2","title":"Together We Know How to Achieve: An Epistemic Logic of Know-How","authors":"Pavel Naumov, Jia Tao","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1705.09349v2","content":"The existence of a coalition strategy to achieve a goal does not necessarily mean that the coalition has enough information to know how to follow the strategy.

Using Information Theory, we develop a responsibility quantification (ResQu) model of human involvement in intelligent automated systems and demonstrate its applications on decisions regarding AWS. The analysis reveals that human comparative responsibility to outcomes is often low, even when major functions are allocated to the human. Thus, broadly stated policies of keeping humans in the loop and having meaningful human control are misleading and cannot truly direct decisions on how to involve humans in intelligent systems and advanced automation. The current model is an initial step in the complex goal to create a comprehensive responsibility model, that will enable quantification of human causal responsibility. It assumes stationarity, full knowledge regarding the characteristic of the human and automation and ignores temporal aspects. Despite these limitations, it can aid in the analysis of systems designs alternatives and policy decisions regarding human responsibility in intelligent systems and advanced automation."},{"id":"2202.05302v1","title":"Trust in AI: Interpretability is not necessary or sufficient, while black-box interaction is necessary and sufficient","authors":"Max W. Shen","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.05302v1","content":"The problem of human trust in artificial intelligence is one of the most fundamental problems in applied machine learning. Our processes for evaluating AI trustworthiness have substantial ramifications for ML's impact on science, health, and humanity, yet confusion surrounds foundational concepts. What does it mean to trust an AI, and how do humans assess AI trustworthiness? What are the mechanisms for building trustworthy AI? And what is the role of interpretable ML in trust? Here, we draw from statistical learning theory and sociological lenses on human-automation trust to motivate an AI-as-tool framework, which distinguishes human-AI trust from human-AI-human trust. Evaluating an AI's contractual trustworthiness involves predicting future model behavior using behavior certificates (BCs) that aggregate behavioral evidence from diverse sources including empirical out-of-distribution and out-of-task evaluation and theoretical proofs linking model architecture to behavior. We clarify the role of interpretability in trust with a ladder of model access. Interpretability (level 3) is not necessary or even sufficient for trust, while the ability to run a black-box model at-will (level 2) is necessary and sufficient. While interpretability can offer benefits for trust, it can also incur costs. We clarify ways interpretability can contribute to trust, while questioning the perceived centrality of interpretability to trust in popular discourse. How can we empower people with tools to evaluate trust? Instead of trying to understand how a model works, we argue for understanding how a model behaves. Instead of opening up black boxes, we should create more behavior certificates that are more correct, relevant, and understandable. We discuss how to build trusted and trustworthy AI responsibly."},{"id":"2204.02889v2","title":"A Cognitive Framework for Delegation Between Error-Prone AI and Human Agents","authors":"Andrew Fuchs, Andrea Passarella, Marco Conti","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2204.02889v2","content":"With humans interacting with AI-based systems at an increasing rate, it is necessary to ensure the artificial systems are acting in a manner which reflects understanding of the human. In the case of humans and artificial AI agents operating in the same environment, we note the significance of comprehension and response to the actions or capabilities of a human from an agent's perspective, as well as the possibility to delegate decisions either to humans or to agents, depending on who is deemed more suitable at a certain point in time. Such capabilities will ensure an improved responsiveness and utility of the entire human-AI system. To that end, we investigate the use of cognitively inspired models of behavior to predict the behavior of both human and AI agents. The predicted behavior, and associated performance with respect to a certain goal, is used to delegate control between humans and AI agents through the use of an intermediary entity. As we demonstrate, this allows overcoming potential shortcomings of either humans or agents in the pursuit of a goal."},{"id":"1912.11095v1","title":"Defining AI in Policy versus Practice","authors":"P.

However, definitional ambiguity hampers the possibility of conversation about this urgent topic of public concern. Legal and regulatory interventions require agreed-upon definitions, but consensus around a definition of AI has been elusive, especially in policy conversations. With an eye towards practical working definitions and a broader understanding of positions on these issues, we survey experts and review published policy documents to examine researcher and policy-maker conceptions of AI. We find that while AI researchers favor definitions of AI that emphasize technical functionality, policy-makers instead use definitions that compare systems to human thinking and behavior. We point out that definitions adhering closely to the functionality of AI systems are more inclusive of technologies in use today, whereas definitions that emphasize human-like capabilities are most applicable to hypothetical future technologies. As a result of this gap, ethical and regulatory efforts may overemphasize concern about future technologies at the expense of pressing issues with existing deployed technologies."},{"id":"1507.07688v3","title":"Belief and Truth in Hypothesised Behaviours","authors":"Stefano V. Albrecht, Jacob W.

This idea has gained increasing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, where it is used as a method to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying a possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with respect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed actions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily in the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many AI applications have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate evidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are correct, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that prior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs in the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent performance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are able complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised types. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis."},{"id":"2110.10024v1","title":"Risks of AI Foundation Models in Education","authors":"Su Lin Blodgett, Michael Madaio","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2110.10024v1","content":"If the authors of a recent Stanford report (Bommasani et al., 2021) on the opportunities and risks of \"foundation models\" are to be believed, these models represent a paradigm shift for AI and for the domains in which they will supposedly be used, including education.

Such technologies have the potential for harm broadly speaking (e.g., Bender et al., 2021), but their use in the educational domain is particularly fraught, despite the potential benefits for learners claimed by the authors. In section 3.3 of the Stanford report, Malik et al. argue that achieving the goal of providing education for all learners requires more efficient computational approaches that can rapidly scale across educational domains and across educational contexts, for which they argue foundation models are uniquely well-suited.

In part, this is driven by incentives and forces in the tech industry, where a more product-driven focus tends to drown out broader reflective concerns about potential harms and misframings. But this focus on what and how is largely a reflection of the engineering and mathematics-focused training in computer science, which emphasizes the building of tools and development of computational concepts.   As a result of this tight technical focus, and the rapid, worldwide explosion in its use, AI has come with a storm of unanticipated socio-technical problems, ranging from algorithms that act in racially or gender-biased ways, get caught in feedback loops that perpetuate inequalities, or enable unprecedented behavioral monitoring surveillance that challenges the fundamental values of free, democratic societies.

The safety controller is endowed with the abilities to predict whether the trained policy will lead the system to an unsafe state, and take over control when necessary. While this architecture can provide added safety assurances, intermittent and frequent switching between the trained policy and the safety controller can result in undesirable behaviors and reduced performance. We propose to reduce or even eliminate control switching by `repairing' the trained policy based on runtime data produced by the safety controller in a way that deviates minimally from the original policy. The key idea behind our approach is the formulation of a trajectory optimization problem that allows the joint reasoning of policy update and safety constraints.

To achieve this, existing safe reinforcement learning methods make an agent rely on priors that let it avoid dangerous situations during exploration with high probability, but both the probabilistic guarantees and the smoothness assumptions inherent in the priors are not viable in many scenarios of interest such as autonomous driving. This paper presents an alternative approach inspired by human teaching, where an agent learns under the supervision of an automatic instructor that saves the agent from violating constraints during learning. In this model, we introduce the monitor that neither needs to know how to do well at the task the agent is learning nor needs to know how the environment works. Instead, it has a library of reset controllers that it activates when the agent starts behaving dangerously, preventing it from doing damage. Crucially, the choices of which reset controller to apply in which situation affect the speed of agent learning. Based on observing agents' progress, the teacher itself learns a policy for choosing the reset controllers, a curriculum, to optimize the agent's final policy reward.

To obtain an empirical understanding of human preferences in different tasks, we build a dataset of 100 tasks from academic papers, popular media portrayal of AI, and everyday life, and administer a survey based on our proposed framework. We find little preference for full AI control and a strong preference for machine-in-the-loop designs, in which humans play the leading role. Among the four factors, trust is the most correlated with human preferences of optimal human-machine delegation. This framework represents a first step towards characterizing human preferences of AI automation across tasks.

This requires agents to have a deeper understanding of auction mechanisms and be able to verify desirable properties of a given mechanism. We have shown how these mechanisms can be formalised as semantic web services in OWL-S, a good enough expressive machine-readable formalism enabling software agents, to discover, invoke, and execute a web service. We have also used abstract interpretation to translate the auction's specifications from OWL-S, based on description logic, to COQ, based on typed lambda calculus, in order to enable automatic verification of desirable properties of the auction by the software agents. For this language translation, we have discussed the syntactic transformation as well as the semantics connections between both concrete and abstract domains.

This document was ultimately adopted by the CAHAI plenary in December 2021. To support this effort, The Alan Turing Institute undertook a programme of research that explored the governance processes and practical tools needed to operationalise the integration of human right due diligence with the assurance of trustworthy AI innovation practices.   The resulting framework was completed and submitted to the Council of Europe in September 2021. It presents an end-to-end approach to the assurance of AI project lifecycles that integrates context-based risk analysis and appropriate stakeholder engagement with comprehensive impact assessment, and transparent risk management, impact mitigation, and innovation assurance practices. Taken together, these interlocking processes constitute a Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law Assurance Framework (HUDERAF). The HUDERAF combines the procedural requirements for principles-based human rights due diligence with the governance mechanisms needed to set up technical and socio-technical guardrails for responsible and trustworthy AI innovation practices. Its purpose is to provide an accessible and user-friendly set of mechanisms for facilitating compliance with a binding legal framework on artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe's standards on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, and to ensure that AI innovation projects are carried out with appropriate levels of public accountability, transparency, and democratic governance."},{"id":"2001.08525v1","title":"Optimal by Design: Model-Driven Synthesis of Adaptation Strategies for Autonomous Systems","authors":"Yehia Elrakaiby, Paola Spoletini, Bashar Nuseibeh","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2001.08525v1","content":"Many software systems have become too large and complex to be managed efficiently by human administrators, particularly when they operate in uncertain and dynamic environments and require frequent changes. Requirements-driven adaptation techniques have been proposed to endow systems with the necessary means to autonomously decide ways to satisfy their requirements. However, many current approaches rely on general-purpose languages, models and\/or frameworks to design, develop and analyze autonomous systems. Unfortunately, these tools are not tailored towards the characteristics of adaptation problems in autonomous systems. In this paper, we present Optimal by Design (ObD ), a framework for model-based requirements-driven synthesis of optimal adaptation strategies for autonomous systems. ObD proposes a model (and a language) for the high-level description of the basic elements of self-adaptive systems, namely the system, capabilities, requirements and environment. Based on those elements, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is constructed to compute the optimal strategy or the most rewarding system behaviour. Furthermore, this defines a reflex controller that can ensure timely responses to changes. One novel feature of the framework is that it benefits both from goal-oriented techniques, developed for requirement elicitation, refinement and analysis, and synthesis capabilities and extensive research around MDPs, their extensions and tools. Our preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the practicality and advantages of the framework."},{"id":"2202.13985v2","title":"The dangers in algorithms learning humans' values and irrationalities","authors":"Rebecca Gorman, Stuart Armstrong","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.13985v2","content":"For an artificial intelligence (AI) to be aligned with human values (or human preferences), it must first learn those values. AI systems that are trained on human behavior, risk miscategorising human irrationalities as human values -- and then optimising for these irrationalities. Simply learning human values still carries risks: AI learning them will inevitably also gain information on human irrationalities and human behaviour\/policy. Both of these can be dangerous: knowing human policy allows an AI to become generically more powerful (whether it is partially aligned or not aligned at all), while learning human irrationalities allows it to exploit humans without needing to provide value in return. This paper analyses the danger in developing artificial intelligence that learns about human irrationalities and human policy, and constructs a model recommendation system with various levels of information about human biases, human policy, and human values. It concludes that, whatever the power and knowledge of the AI, it is more dangerous for it to know human irrationalities than human values. Thus it is better for the AI to learn human values directly, rather than learning human biases and then deducing values from behaviour."},{"id":"1804.01396v1","title":"Artificial Intelligence and its Role in Near Future","authors":"Jahanzaib Shabbir, Tarique Anwer","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1804.01396v1","content":"AI technology has a long history which is actively and constantly changing and growing.

Thus, it is important to determine the portion of resources we wish to apply to metareasoning and control versus to the execution of a solution plan. Recent research on rational agency has highlighted the importance of limiting the consumption of resources by metareasoning machinery. We shall introduce the metareasoning-partition problem--the problem of ideally apportioning costly reasoning resources to planning a solution versus applying resource to executing a solution to a problem. We exercise prototypical metareasoning-partition models to probe the relationships between time allocated to metareasoning and to execution for different problem classes.

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that suggests that -- instead of hard-coding road rules into self-driving algorithms -- a scalable alternative may be to design multi-agent environments in which road rules emerge as optimal solutions to the problem of maximizing traffic flow. We analyze what ingredients in driving environments cause the emergence of these road rules and find that two crucial factors are noisy perception and agents' spatial density. We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of the emergence of seven social driving behaviors, ranging from obeying traffic signals to following lanes, all of which emerge from training agents to drive quickly to destinations without colliding. Our results add empirical support for the social road rules that countries worldwide have agreed on for safe, efficient driving."},{"id":"1401.3426v1","title":"Networks of Influence Diagrams: A Formalism for Representing Agents' Beliefs and Decision-Making Processes","authors":"Yaakov Gal, Avi Pfeffer","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1401.3426v1","content":"This paper presents Networks of Influence Diagrams (NID), a compact, natural and highly expressive language for reasoning about agents beliefs and decision-making processes. NIDs are graphical structures in which agents mental models are represented as nodes in a network; a mental model for an agent may itself use descriptions of the mental models of other agents. NIDs are demonstrated by examples, showing how they can be used to describe conflicting and cyclic belief structures, and certain forms of bounded rationality. In an opponent modeling domain, NIDs were able to outperform other computational agents whose strategies were not known in advance. NIDs are equivalent in representation to Bayesian games but they are more compact and structured than this formalism. In particular, the equilibrium definition for NIDs makes an explicit distinction between agents optimal strategies, and how they actually behave in reality."},{"id":"2007.07703v1","title":"Failures of Contingent Thinking","authors":"Evan Piermont, Peio Zuazo-Garin","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2007.07703v1","content":"In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework to analyze an agent who misinterprets or misperceives the true decision problem she faces.

When the agent's task plans are generated without such considerations, they may often demonstrate inexplicable behavior from the human's point of view. This problem may arise due to the human's partial or inaccurate understanding of the agent's planning model. This may have serious implications from increased cognitive load to more serious concerns of safety around a physical agent. In this paper, we address this issue by modeling plan explicability as a function of the distance between a plan that agent makes and the plan that human expects it to make. We learn a regression model for mapping the plan distances to explicability scores of plans and develop an anytime search algorithm that can use this model as a heuristic to come up with progressively explicable plans.

This is crucial for activities such as teaching, offering assistance, and deciding between blame or forgiveness. However, Bayesian models of theory of mind have generally not accounted for these mistakes, instead modeling agents as mostly optimal in achieving their goals. As a result, they are unable to explain phenomena like locking oneself out of one's house, or losing a game of chess. Here, we extend the Bayesian Theory of Mind framework to model boundedly rational agents who may have mistaken goals, plans, and actions. We formalize this by modeling agents as probabilistic programs, where goals may be confused with semantically similar states, plans may be misguided due to resource-bounded planning, and actions may be unintended due to execution errors. We present experiments eliciting human goal inferences in two domains: (i) a gridworld puzzle with gems locked behind doors, and (ii) a block-stacking domain. Our model better explains human inferences than alternatives, while generalizing across domains. These findings indicate the importance of modeling others as bounded agents, in order to account for the full richness of human intuitive psychology."},{"id":"2204.03361v1","title":"Robust Event-Driven Interactions in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning","authors":"Daniel Jarne Ornia, Manuel Mazo Jr","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2204.03361v1","content":"We present an approach to reduce the communication required between agents in a Multi-Agent learning system by exploiting the inherent robustness of the underlying Markov Decision Process.

This results in fully distributed decision functions, enabling agents to decide when it is necessary to update others. We derive bounds on the optimality of the resulting systems in terms of the discounted sum of rewards obtained, and show these bounds are a function of the design parameters. Additionally, we extend the results for the case where the robustness surrogate functions are learned from data, and present experimental results demonstrating a significant reduction in communication events between agents."},{"id":"2107.13734v1","title":"An Ethical Framework for Guiding the Development of Affectively-Aware Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Desmond C.

The goal of this article is to pre-empt some of the potential implications of these developments, and propose a set of guidelines for evaluating the (moral and) ethical consequences of affectively-aware AI, in order to guide researchers, industry professionals, and policy-makers. We propose a multi-stakeholder analysis framework that separates the ethical responsibilities of AI Developers vis-\\`a-vis the entities that deploy such AI -- which we term Operators.

Sometimes, the information was not stored in the same data lake or format and was not able to communicate. But in creating new bridges with AI, many problems appeared such as bias reproduction, unfair inferences or mass surveillance. Our aim is to show that, on one hand, the AI's deep ethical problem lays essentially in these new connections made possible by systems interoperability. In connecting the spheres of our life, these systems undermine the notion of justice particular to each of them, because the new interactions create dominances of social goods from a sphere to another. These systems make therefore spheres permeable to one another and, in doing so, they open to progress as well as to tyranny.

There has been a tremendous success in applying them for narrow intellectual tasks such as pattern recognition, natural language processing and playing Go. The latter application vastly outperforms the strongest human player in recent years. However, these tasks are formalized by people in such ways that it has become \"easy\" for automated recipes to find better solutions than humans do. In the sense of John Searle's Chinese Room Argument, the computer playing Go does not actually understand anything from the game. Thinking like a human mind requires to go beyond the curve fitting paradigm of current systems. There is a fundamental limit to what they can achieve currently as only very specific problem formalization can increase their performances in particular tasks. In this paper, we argue than one of the most important aspects of the human mind is its capacity for logical thinking, which gives rise to many intellectual expressions that differentiate us from animal brains.

This list is not intended as exhaustive, nor is it seen to preclude entirely a clear ontology, however, these challenges are a necessary set of topics for consideration. Each of these factors is seen to present a 'moving target' for discussion, which poses a challenge for both technical specialists and non-practitioners of AI systems development (e.g., philosophers and theologians) to speak meaningfully given that the corpus of AI structures and capabilities evolves at a rapid pace.

To guarantee performance while assuring satisfaction of safety constraints across variety of circumstances, an assured autonomous control framework is presented in this paper by empowering RL algorithms with metacognitive learning capabilities. More specifically, adapting the reward function parameters of the RL agent is performed in a metacognitive decision-making layer to assure the feasibility of RL agent. That is, to assure that the learned policy by the RL agent satisfies safety constraints specified by signal temporal logic while achieving as much performance as possible. The metacognitive layer monitors any possible future safety violation under the actions of the RL agent and employs a higher-layer Bayesian RL algorithm to proactively adapt the reward function for the lower-layer RL agent. To minimize the higher-layer Bayesian RL intervention, a fitness function is leveraged by the metacognitive layer as a metric to evaluate success of the lower-layer RL agent in satisfaction of safety and liveness specifications, and the higher-layer Bayesian RL intervenes only if there is a risk of lower-layer RL failure.

Often, an adequate understanding of these models is required when focusing on the transparency of decisions in human-critical applications. Besides other explainability techniques, trustworthiness can be achieved by using counterfactuals, like the way a human becomes familiar with an unknown process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under which the output changes. In this work we argue that automated counterfactual generation should regard several aspects of the produced adversarial instances, not only their adversarial capability. To this end, we present a novel framework for the generation of counterfactual examples which formulates its goal as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing three different objectives: 1) plausibility, i.e., the likeliness of the counterfactual of being possible as per the distribution of the input data; 2) intensity of the changes to the original input; and 3) adversarial power, namely, the variability of the model's output induced by the counterfactual. The framework departs from a target model to be audited and uses a Generative Adversarial Network to model the distribution of input data, together with a multi-objective solver for the discovery of counterfactuals balancing among these objectives. The utility of the framework is showcased over six classification tasks comprising image and three-dimensional data. The experiments verify that the framework unveils counterfactuals that comply with intuition, increasing the trustworthiness of the user, and leading to further insights, such as the detection of bias and data misrepresentation."},{"id":"2101.12047v1","title":"Measuring Intelligence and Growth Rate: Variations on Hibbard's Intelligence Measure","authors":"Samuel Alexander, Bill Hibbard","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2101.12047v1","content":"In 2011, Hibbard suggested an intelligence measure for agents who compete in an adversarial sequence prediction game.

Whereas Hibbard's intelligence measure is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an intelligence measure should look like.

In order to establish the difference between generalized loss and specialized losses, we will train several models using the above-mentioned losses and then compare their robustness on adversarial examples.

Such systems are increasingly ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any particular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans; however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet inexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for AI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of two applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that human's ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We argue that these four properties will support practically-minded professionals to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control."},{"id":"2112.07773v1","title":"Filling gaps in trustworthy development of AI","authors":"Shahar Avin, Haydn Belfield, Miles Brundage, Gretchen Krueger, Jasmine Wang, Adrian Weller, Markus Anderljung, Igor Krawczuk, David Krueger, Jonathan Lebensold, Tegan Maharaj, Noa Zilberman","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2112.07773v1","content":"The range of application of artificial intelligence (AI) is vast, as is the potential for harm.

We estimate where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same network from scratch using the original ID samples and the generated samples with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding the entropy of the predicted softmax probability.

However, independence in this form can only exist in a 2-monotone probability function in degenerate cases i.e., if the prior bounds are either point probabilities or entirely vacuous. Additional limitations are characterized for other classes of lower probabilities as well. It is argued that these phenomena are simply a matter of interpretation. They appear to be limitations when one interprets probability bounds as a measure of epistemological indeterminacy (i.e., uncertainty arising from a lack of knowledge), but are exactly as one would expect when probability intervals are interpreted as representations of ontological indeterminacy (indeterminacy introduced by structural approximations).

At first blush, these three requirements seem contradictory. For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore, although formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability, it is known to be time-consuming. Our solution to the challenge of satisfying all three requirements is the following. Agents have finite-state automaton plans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation) operators. To ensure that critical behavioral constraints are always satisfied, agents' plans are first formally verified. They are then reverified after every adaptation. If reverification concludes that constraints are violated, the plans are repaired. The main objective of this paper is to improve the efficiency of reverification after learning, so that agents have a sufficiently rapid response time. We present two solutions: positive results that certain learning operators are a priori guaranteed to preserve useful classes of behavioral assurance constraints (which implies that no reverification is needed for these operators), and efficient incremental reverification algorithms for those learning operators that have negative a priori results."},{"id":"1910.06266v1","title":"Using AI\/ML to gain situational understanding from passive network observations","authors":"D.

There is a clear need for companies and regulators to manage the risk from proposed ML systems before they harm people. To achieve this, private and public sector actors first need to identify the risks posed by a proposed ML system. A system's overall risk is influenced by its direct and indirect effects. However, existing frameworks for ML risk\/impact assessment often address an abstract notion of risk or do not concretize this dependence.   We propose to address this gap with a context-sensitive framework for identifying ML system risks comprising two components: a taxonomy of the first- and second-order risks posed by ML systems, and their contributing factors. First-order risks stem from aspects of the ML system, while second-order risks stem from the consequences of first-order risks. These consequences are system failures that result from design and development choices. We explore how different risks may manifest in various types of ML systems, the factors that affect each risk, and how first-order risks may lead to second-order effects when the system interacts with the real world.   Throughout the paper, we show how real events and prior research fit into our Machine Learning System Risk framework (MLSR). MLSR operates on ML systems rather than technologies or domains, recognizing that a system's design, implementation, and use case all contribute to its risk. In doing so, it unifies the risks that are commonly discussed in the ethical AI community (e.g., ethical\/human rights risks) with system-level risks (e.g., application, design, control risks), paving the way for holistic risk assessments of ML systems."},{"id":"1604.04728v1","title":"Reaching Unanimous Agreements Within Agent-Based Negotiation Teams With Linear and Monotonic Utility Functions","authors":"Victor Sanchez-Anguix, Vicente Julian, Vicente Botti, Ana Garcia-Fornes","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1604.04728v1","content":"In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented.

The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round.

This paper presents an algorithm for discovering from scratch the suite of high-level \"capabilities\" that an AI system with arbitrary internal planning algorithms\/policies can perform. It computes conditions describing the applicability and effects of these capabilities in user-interpretable terms. Starting from a set of user-interpretable state properties, an AI agent, and a simulator that the agent can interact with, using arbitrary decision-making paradigms over primitive operations (unknown to the user), our algorithm returns a set of high-level capabilities with capability descriptions in the user's vocabulary. Empirical evaluation on several game-based scenarios shows that this approach efficiently learns interpretable descriptions of various types of AI agents in deterministic, fully observable settings.

As current data interaction systems assume that users do not modify their strategies, they cannot discover the information needs behind users' queries effectively. We model the interaction between users and DBMS as a game with identical interest between two rational agents whose goal is to establish a common language for representing information needs in form of queries.

In this paper, we investigate the use of empowerment in the presence of an extrinsic reward signal. We hypothesize that empowerment can guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents to find good early behavioral solutions by encouraging highly empowered states. We propose a unified Bellman optimality principle for empowered reward maximization. Our empowered reward maximization approach generalizes both Bellman's optimality principle as well as recent information-theoretical extensions to it.

An increasingly prominent research area in AI is ethics, which currently has no set of benchmarks nor commonly accepted way for measuring the 'ethicality' of an AI system. In this paper, drawing upon research in moral philosophy and metaethics, we argue that it is impossible to develop such a benchmark. As such, alternative mechanisms are necessary for evaluating whether an AI system is 'ethical'. This is especially pressing in light of the prevalence of applied, industrial AI research. We argue that it makes more sense to talk about 'values' (and 'value alignment') rather than 'ethics' when considering the possible actions of present and future AI systems. We further highlight that, because values are unambiguously relative, focusing on values forces us to consider explicitly what the values are and whose values they are. Shifting the emphasis from ethics to values therefore gives rise to several new ways of understanding how researchers might advance research programmes for robustly safe or beneficial AI. We conclude by highlighting a number of possible ways forward for the field as a whole, and we advocate for different approaches towards more value-aligned AI research."},{"id":"2102.07152v1","title":"On the Equilibrium Elicitation of Markov Games Through Information Design","authors":"Tao Zhang, Quanyan Zhu","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2102.07152v1","content":"This work considers a novel information design problem and studies how the craft of payoff-relevant environmental signals solely can influence the behaviors of intelligent agents.

While curricula are also useful for artificial agents, hand-crafting them is time consuming. This has lead researchers to explore automatic curriculum generation. Here we explore automatic curriculum generation in rich, dynamic environments. Using a setter-solver paradigm we show the importance of considering goal validity, goal feasibility, and goal coverage to construct useful curricula. We demonstrate the success of our approach in rich but sparsely rewarding 2D and 3D environments, where an agent is tasked to achieve a single goal selected from a set of possible goals that varies between episodes, and identify challenges for future work. Finally, we demonstrate the value of a novel technique that guides agents towards a desired goal distribution.

I then address (a slight generalization of) Newcomb's paradox. I solve the specific case where the player believes that the predictor applies Bayes rule with a supset of all the data available to the player. I prove that the counterfactual optimality of the 1-Box strategy depends on the player's prior on the predictor's additional data. If these additional data are not expected to reduce sufficiently the predictor's uncertainty on the player's decision, then the player's epistemic system will counterfactually prefer to 2-Box.

With it, we can live longer in a healthy body, save time through increased efficiency and automation, and make better decisions. To get to the next level, we need to start looking at intelligence from a much broader perspective, and promote international interdisciplinary collaborations. Section 1 of this paper delves into sociology and social psychology to explain that the mechanisms underlying intelligence are inherently social. Section 2 proposes a method to classify intelligence, and describes the differences between weak and strong intelligence. Section 3 examines the Chinese Room argument from a different perspective. It demonstrates that a Turing-complete machine cannot have strong intelligence, and considers the modifications necessary for a computer to be intelligent and have understanding. Section 4 argues that the existential risk caused by the technological explosion of a single agent should not be of serious concern. Section 5 looks at the AI control problem and argues that it is impossible to build a super-intelligent machine that will do what it creators want. By using insights from biology, it also proposes a solution to the control problem. Section 6 discusses some of the implications of strong intelligence. Section 7 lists the main challenges with deep learning, and asserts that radical changes will be required to reach strong intelligence. Section 8 examines a neuroscience framework that could help explain how a cortical column works. Section 9 lays out the broad strokes of a road map towards strong intelligence. Finally, section 10 analyzes the impacts and the challenges of greater intelligence."},{"id":"1903.01003v3","title":"Hacking Google reCAPTCHA v3 using Reinforcement Learning","authors":"Ismail Akrout, Amal Feriani, Mohamed Akrout","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1903.01003v3","content":"We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodology to bypass Google reCAPTCHA v3.

In an iterative process, the center sends comparison queries to voters, requesting them to submit their preference between two items. Voters might discuss the candidates among themselves, figuring out during the elicitation process which candidates stand a chance of winning and which do not. Consequently, strategic voters might attempt to manipulate by deviating from their true preferences and instead submit a different response in order to attempt to maximize their profit. We provide a practical algorithm for strategic voters which computes the best manipulative vote and maximizes the voter's selfish outcome when such a vote exists. We also provide a careful voting center which is aware of the possible manipulations and avoids manipulative queries when possible. In an empirical study on four real-world domains, we show that in practice manipulation occurs in a low percentage of settings and has a low impact on the final outcome. The careful voting center reduces manipulation even further, thus allowing for a non-distorted group decision process to take place. We thus provide a core technology study of a voting process that can be adopted in opinion or information aggregation systems and in crowdsourcing applications, e.g., peer grading in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)."},{"id":"1912.06817v1","title":"Ten AI Stepping Stones for Cybersecurity","authors":"Ricardo Morla","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1912.06817v1","content":"With the turmoil in cybersecurity and the mind-blowing advances in AI, it is only natural that cybersecurity practitioners consider further employing learning techniques to help secure their organizations and improve the efficiency of their security operation centers.

This paper discusses ten issues in cybersecurity that hopefully will make it easier for practitioners to ask detailed questions about what they want from an AI system in their cybersecurity operations. We draw on the state of the art to provide factual arguments for a discussion on well-established AI in cybersecurity issues, including the current scope of AI and its application to cybersecurity, the impact of privacy concerns on the cybersecurity data that can be collected and shared externally to the organization, how an AI decision can be explained to the person running the operations center, and the implications of the adversarial nature of cybersecurity in the learning techniques.

Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for learning policies when the expert's behavior is available as a fixed set of trajectories. We evaluate in terms of the expert's cost function and observe that the distribution of trajectory-costs is often more heavy-tailed for GAIL-agents than the expert at a number of benchmark continuous-control tasks. Thus, high-cost trajectories, corresponding to tail-end events of catastrophic failure, are more likely to be encountered by the GAIL-agents than the expert. This makes the reliability of GAIL-agents questionable when it comes to deployment in risk-sensitive applications like robotic surgery and autonomous driving. In this work, we aim to minimize the occurrence of tail-end events by minimizing tail risk within the GAIL framework. We quantify tail risk by the Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of trajectories and develop the Risk-Averse Imitation Learning (RAIL) algorithm. We observe that the policies learned with RAIL show lower tail-end risk than those of vanilla GAIL. Thus the proposed RAIL algorithm appears as a potent alternative to GAIL for improved reliability in risk-sensitive applications."},{"id":"2107.03721v3","title":"Demystifying the Draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act","authors":"Michael Veale, Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.03721v3","content":"In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence, known as the AI Act.

Aspects of the AI Act, such as different rules for different risk-levels of AI, make sense. But we also find that some provisions of the Draft AI Act have surprising legal implications, whilst others may be largely ineffective at achieving their stated goals.

The general idea is to take advantage of the quantum interference terms produced in the quantum-like Bayesian Network to influence the probabilities used to compute the expected utility of some action. This way, we are not proposing a new type of expected utility hypothesis. On the contrary, we are keeping it under its classical definition. We are only incorporating it as an extension of a probabilistic graphical model in a compact graphical representation called an influence diagram in which the utility function depends on the probabilistic influences of the quantum-like Bayesian network.   Our findings suggest that the proposed quantum-like influence digram can indeed take advantage of the quantum interference effects of quantum-like Bayesian Networks to maximise the utility of a cooperative behaviour in detriment of a fully rational defect behaviour under the prisoner's dilemma game."},{"id":"2202.09516v1","title":"Learning a Shield from Catastrophic Action Effects: Never Repeat the Same Mistake","authors":"Shahaf S. Shperberg, Bo Liu, Peter Stone","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.09516v1","content":"Agents that operate in an unknown environment are bound to make mistakes while learning, including, at least occasionally, some that lead to catastrophic consequences. When humans make catastrophic mistakes, they are expected to learn never to repeat them, such as a toddler who touches a hot stove and immediately learns never to do so again. In this work we consider a novel class of POMDPs, called POMDP with Catastrophic Actions (POMDP-CA) in which pairs of states and actions are labeled as catastrophic. Agents that act in a POMDP-CA do not have a priori knowledge about which (state, action) pairs are catastrophic, thus they are sure to make mistakes when trying to learn any meaningful policy. Rather, their aim is to maximize reward while never repeating mistakes.   As a first step of avoiding mistake repetition, we leverage the concept of a shield which prevents agents from executing specific actions from specific states.   In particular, we store catastrophic mistakes (unsafe pairs of states and actions) that agents make in a database. Agents are then forbidden to pick actions that appear in the database. This approach is especially useful in a continual learning setting, where groups of agents perform a variety of tasks over time in the same underlying environment. In this setting, a task-agnostic shield can be constructed in a way that stores mistakes made by any agent, such that once one agent in a group makes a mistake the entire group learns to never repeat that mistake. This paper introduces a variant of the PPO algorithm that utilizes this shield, called ShieldPPO, and empirically evaluates it in a controlled environment.   Results indicate that ShieldPPO outperforms PPO, as well as baseline methods from the safe reinforcement learning literature, in a range of settings."},{"id":"2108.11004v1","title":"Reasoning about Counterfactuals and Explanations: Problems, Results and Directions","authors":"Leopoldo Bertossi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2108.11004v1","content":"There are some recent approaches and results about the use of answer-set programming for specifying counterfactual interventions on entities under classification, and reasoning about them.

Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring small modifications to an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. Our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Our algorithm successfully solves a benchmark multi-digit addition task and generalizes to long sequences.

Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical decision for a network's success, usually done in a manual manner. As a straightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are selected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper weights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of the final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network become simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly parameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy creation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing irrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires measuring the contribution of individual components such as neurons. In previous work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as contribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper theoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic measures, namely the Shapley value (SV), in order to separate relevant from irrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a coalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form coalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the Shapley value. In order to measure how well the Shapley value measures the contribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and measure its impact on the network performance. In our experiments we show that the Shapley value outperforms other heuristics for measuring the contribution of neurons."},{"id":"2101.09385v1","title":"Outlining Traceability: A Principle for Operationalizing Accountability in Computing Systems","authors":"Joshua A.

But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners. This map reframes existing discussions around accountability and transparency, using the principle of traceability to show how, when, and why transparency can be deployed to serve accountability goals and thereby improve the normative fidelity of systems and their development processes."},{"id":"2102.10985v1","title":"Software Architecture for Next-Generation AI Planning Systems","authors":"Sebastian Graef, Ilche Georgievski","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2102.10985v1","content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning is a flourishing research and development discipline that provides powerful tools for searching a course of action that achieves some user goal.

Agents can be endowed with an inductive bias towards abstraction through meta-learning, where they are trained on a distribution of tasks that share some abstract structure that can be learned and applied. However, because neural networks are hard to interpret, it can be difficult to tell whether agents have learned the underlying abstraction, or alternatively statistical patterns that are characteristic of that abstraction. In this work, we compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules. We define a novel methodology for building \"task metamers\" that closely match the statistics of the abstract tasks but use a different underlying generative process, and evaluate performance on both abstract and metamer tasks. In our first set of experiments, we found that humans perform better at abstract tasks than metamer tasks whereas a widely-used meta-reinforcement learning agent performs worse on the abstract tasks than the matched metamers. In a second set of experiments, we base the tasks on abstractions derived directly from empirically identified human priors. We utilize the same procedure to generate corresponding metamer tasks, and see the same double dissociation between humans and agents.

We offer a formalisation to allow agents to plan for multiple goals and norms in the presence of durative actions that can be executed concurrently. We compare plans based on decision-theoretic notions (i.e. utility) such that the utility gain of goals and utility loss of norm violations are the basis for this comparison. The set of optimal plans consists of plans that maximise the overall utility, each of which can be chosen by the agent to execute.

The limited size of the data set hinders the estimate of the Value function of the relative Markov Decision Process (MDP), bounding the performance of the obtained policy in the real world. In this context, recent works showed that planning with a discount factor lower than the one used during the evaluation phase yields more performing policies. However, the optimal discount factor is finally chosen by cross-validation. Our aim is to show that looking for a sub-optimal solution of a Bayesian MDP might lead to better performances with respect to the current baselines that work in the offline setting. Hence, we propose Exploitation vs Caution (EvC), an algorithm that automatically selects the policy that solves a Risk-sensitive Bayesian MDP in a set of policies obtained by solving several MDPs characterized by different discount factors and transition dynamics. On one hand, the Bayesian formalism elegantly includes model uncertainty and on another hand the introduction of a risk-sensitive utility function guarantees robustness. We evaluated the proposed approach in different discrete simple environments offering a fair variety of MDP classes. We also compared the obtained results with state-of-the-art offline learning for planning baselines such as MOPO and MOReL.

A `solver quality' metric is formally defined in the context of decision making algorithms based on Markov decision processes. A method for assessing solver quality is then derived, drawing inspiration from empirical hardness models. Finally, numerical experiments for an unmanned autonomous vehicle navigation problem under different solver, parameter, and environment conditions indicate that the self-confidence metric exhibits the desired properties. Discussion of results, and avenues for future investigation are included."},{"id":"2008.02790v4","title":"Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation for Meta-Reinforcement Learning without Sacrifices","authors":"Evan Zheran Liu, Aditi Raghunathan, Percy Liang, Chelsea Finn","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2008.02790v4","content":"The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks. Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration. Empirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex meta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation.

Given that AI systems differ in their level of trustworthiness, two open questions come to the fore: how should AI trustworthiness be responsibly communicated to ensure appropriate and equitable trust judgments by different users, and how can we protect users from deceptive attempts to earn their trust? We draw from communication theories and literature on trust in technologies to develop a conceptual model called MATCH, which describes how trustworthiness is communicated in AI systems through trustworthiness cues and how those cues are processed by people to make trust judgments. Besides AI-generated content, we highlight transparency and interaction as AI systems' affordances that present a wide range of trustworthiness cues to users. By bringing to light the variety of users' cognitive processes to make trust judgments and their potential limitations, we urge technology creators to make conscious decisions in choosing reliable trustworthiness cues for target users and, as an industry, to regulate this space and prevent malicious use. Towards these goals, we define the concepts of warranted trustworthiness cues and expensive trustworthiness cues, and propose a checklist of requirements to help technology creators identify appropriate cues to use. We present a hypothetical use case to illustrate how practitioners can use MATCH to design AI systems responsibly, and discuss future directions for research and industry efforts aimed at promoting responsible trust in AI."},{"id":"2103.15551v7","title":"Toward Building Science Discovery Machines","authors":"Abdullah Khalili, Abdelhamid Bouchachia","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2103.15551v7","content":"The dream of building machines that can do science has inspired scientists for decades.

We review different machine learning techniques used in scientific discovery with their limitations. We survey and discuss the main principles driving the scientific discovery process. These principles are used in different fields and by different scientists to solve problems and discover new knowledge. We provide many examples of the use of these principles in different fields such as physics, mathematics, and biology. We also review AI systems that attempt to implement some of these principles.

Learning from data starts from observations and then proceeds to broader generalizations. This framework is controversial in science, yet it has achieved remarkable engineering successes. This paper reflects on some epistemological issues and some of the limitations of the knowledge discovered in data. The document discusses the common perception that getting more data is the key to achieving better machine learning models from theoretical and practical perspectives. The paper sheds some light on the shortcomings of using generic mathematical theories to describe the process. It further highlights the need for theories specialized in learning from data. While more data leverages the performance of machine learning models in general, the relation in practice is shown to be logarithmic at its best; After a specific limit, more data stabilize or degrade the machine learning models. Recent work in reinforcement learning showed that the trend is shifting away from data-oriented approaches and relying more on algorithms. The paper concludes that learning from data is hindered by many limitations. Hence an approach that has an intensional orientation is needed."},{"id":"2101.02032v5","title":"Socially Responsible AI Algorithms: Issues, Purposes, and Challenges","authors":"Lu Cheng, Kush R.

Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI's indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives.

It helps us to understand what sort of obligations we owe to machines, and what obligations they owe to us. It clears up the issue of assigning responsibility to machines or their creators.

By combining elements from institutional theory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual framework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction of novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which algorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing institutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which organizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure and governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still are unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be contested.

In this paper, we present a case study with Deep Learning (DL) experts from a research and development laboratory focused on the delivery of industrial-strength AI technologies. Our aim was to investigate the social meaning (i.e. meaning to others) that DL experts assign to what they do, given a richly contextualized and familiar domain of application. Using qualitative research techniques to collect and analyze empirical data, our study has shown that participating DL experts did not spontaneously engage into considerations about the social meaning of machine learning models that they build. Moreover, when explicitly stimulated to do so, these experts expressed expectations that, with real-world DL application, there will be available mediators to bridge the gap between technical meanings that drive DL work, and social meanings that AI technology users assign to it. We concluded that current research incentives and values guiding the participants' scientific interests and conduct are at odds with those required to face some of the scientific challenges involved in advancing XAI, and thus responding to the alleged data owners' right to explanations or similar societal demands emerging from current debates. As a concrete contribution to mitigate what seems to be a more general problem, we propose three preliminary XAI Mediation Challenges with the potential to bring together technical and social meanings of DL applications, as well as to foster much needed interdisciplinary collaboration among AI and the Social Sciences researchers."},{"id":"1910.07089v1","title":"Challenges of Human-Aware AI Systems","authors":"Subbarao Kambhampati","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.07089v1","content":"From its inception, AI has had a rather ambivalent relationship to humans---swinging between their augmentation and replacement.

We introduce a policy distilling algorithm, building on the CN2 rule mining algorithm, that distills the policy into a rule-based decision system. At the core of our approach is the fact that an RL process does not just learn a policy, a mapping from states to actions, but also produces extra meta-information, such as action values indicating the quality of alternative actions. This meta-information can indicate whether more than one action is near-optimal for a certain state. We extend CN2 to make it able to leverage knowledge about equally-good actions to distill the policy into fewer rules, increasing its interpretability by a person. Then, to ensure that the rules explain a valid, non-degenerate policy, we introduce a refinement algorithm that fine-tunes the rules to obtain good performance when executed in the environment. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on the Mario AI benchmark, a complex task that requires modern reinforcement learning algorithms including neural networks. The explanations we produce capture the learned policy in only a few rules, that allow a person to understand what the black-box agent learned.

In contrast to prior work, we do not rely on privileged information on the black box, but rather investigate the problem under a weaker assumption of having only access to inputs and outputs of the program. We approach this problem by iteratively refining a candidate set using a generative neural program synthesis approach until we arrive at a functionally equivalent program.

We propose an information-theoretic approach to the inference of agent decisions under Smithian competition. The model explicitly captures the boundedness of agents (limited in their information-processing capacity) as the cost of information acquisition for expanding their prior beliefs. The expansion is measured as the Kullblack-Leibler divergence between posterior decisions and prior beliefs. When information acquisition is free, the homo economicus agent is recovered, while in cases when information acquisition becomes costly, agents instead revert to their prior beliefs. The maximum entropy principle is used to infer least-biased decisions based upon the notion of Smithian competition formalised within the Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium framework. The incorporation of prior beliefs into such a framework allowed us to systematically explore the effects of prior beliefs on decision-making in the presence of market feedback, as well as importantly adding a temporal interpretation to the framework. We verified the proposed model using Australian housing market data, showing how the incorporation of prior knowledge alters the resulting agent decisions. Specifically, it allowed for the separation of past beliefs and utility maximisation behaviour of the agent as well as the analysis into the evolution of agent beliefs."},{"id":"1904.11737v2","title":"Using Sub-Optimal Plan Detection to Identify Commitment Abandonment in Discrete Environments","authors":"Ramon Fraga Pereira, Nir Oren, Felipe Meneguzzi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1904.11737v2","content":"Assessing whether an agent has abandoned a goal or is actively pursuing it is important when multiple agents are trying to achieve joint goals, or when agents commit to achieving goals for each other. Making such a determination for a single goal by observing only plan traces is not trivial as agents often deviate from optimal plans for various reasons, including the pursuit of multiple goals or the inability to act optimally. In this article, we develop an approach based on domain independent heuristics from automated planning, landmarks, and fact partitions to identify sub-optimal action steps - with respect to a plan - within a plan execution trace. Such capability is very important in domains where multiple agents cooperate and delegate tasks among themselves, e.g. through social commitments, and need to ensure that a delegating agent can infer whether or not another agent is actually progressing towards a delegated task. We demonstrate how an agent can use our technique to determine - by observing a trace - whether an agent is honouring a commitment. We empirically show, for a number of representative domains, that our approach infers sub-optimal action steps with very high accuracy and detects commitment abandonment in nearly all cases."},{"id":"2106.11022v1","title":"Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Roel Dobbe, Thomas Krendl Gilbert, Yonatan Mintz","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2106.11022v1","content":"As AI systems are integrated into high stakes social domains, researchers now examine how to design and operate them in a safe and ethical manner.

We show how this vagueness cannot be resolved through mathematical formalism alone, instead requiring deliberation about the politics of development as well as the context of deployment. Drawing from a new sociotechnical lexicon, we redefine vagueness in terms of distinct design challenges at key stages in AI system development. The resulting framework of Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) empowers developers by 1) identifying points of overlap between design decisions and major sociotechnical challenges; 2) motivating the creation of stakeholder feedback channels so that safety issues can be exhaustively addressed.

However, empirical studies have found mixed and even negative results. An open question, therefore, is under what conditions explanations can improve human understanding and in what way. Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the interplay between machine explanations and human understanding, and show how human intuitions play a central role in enabling human understanding. Specifically, we identify three core concepts of interest that cover all existing quantitative measures of understanding in the context of human-AI decision making: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model error. Our key result is that without assumptions about task-specific intuitions, explanations may potentially improve human understanding of model decision boundary, but they cannot improve human understanding of task decision boundary or model error. To achieve complementary human-AI performance, we articulate possible ways on how explanations need to work with human intuitions. For instance, human intuitions about the relevance of features (e.g., education is more important than age in predicting a person's income) can be critical in detecting model error. We validate the importance of human intuitions in shaping the outcome of machine explanations with empirical human-subject studies.

Turing's appeal to fair play suggests a need to correct human behavior to accommodate our machines, a surprising inversion of how value alignment is treated today. Reflections on \"fair play\" motivate a novel interpretation of Turing's notorious \"imitation game\" as a condition not of intelligence but instead of value alignment: a machine demonstrates a minimal degree of alignment (with the norms of conversation, for instance) when it can go undetected when interrogated by a human. I carefully distinguish this interpretation from the Moral Turing Test, which is not motivated by a principle of fair play, but instead depends on imitation of human moral behavior. Finally, I consider how the framework of fair play can be used to situate the debate over robot rights within the alignment literature.

We assume that the benefits would be considerable: Modern CPS have become increasingly complex and evolved beyond traditional methods of modelling and analysis. At the same time, these CPS are confronted with an increasing amount of stochastic inputs, from volatile energy sources in power grids to broad user participation stemming from markets. Approaches of system modelling that use techniques from the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) do not focus on analysis and operation. In this paper, we describe the concept of Adversarial Resilience Learning (ARL) that formulates a new approach to complex environment checking and resilient operation: It defines two agent classes, attacker and defender agents. The quintessence of ARL lies in both agents exploring the system and training each other without any domain knowledge. Here, we introduce the ARL software architecture that allows to use a wide range of model-free as well as model-based DRL-based algorithms, and document results of concrete experiment runs on a complex power grid."},{"id":"1302.6837v1","title":"Anytime Decision Making with Imprecise Probabilities","authors":"Michael Pittarelli","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1302.6837v1","content":"This paper examines methods of decision making that are able to accommodate limitations on both the form in which uncertainty pertaining to a decision problem can be realistically represented and the amount of computing time available before a decision must be made.

In order to change this we will introduce some parameters to which AI will depend. One of this parameters will be the level of intelligence and we will define one AI to each level of intelligence. We assume that for some level of intelligence the respective AI will be more intelligent than a human being.

A variety of modelling approaches now exist which vary widely in their methodology and underlying assumptions, catering to the needs of the different sub-communities within which they were developed and reflecting the different practical uses for which they are intended.

Some common flaws are been noticed in the past defence models that were broken in very short time. Defence models being broken so easily is a point of concern as decision of many crucial activities are taken with the help of machine learning models. So there is an utter need of some defence checkpoints that any researcher should keep in mind while evaluating the soundness of technique and declaring it to be decent defence technique. In this paper, we have suggested few checkpoints that should be taken into consideration while building and evaluating the soundness of defence models. All these points are recommended after observing why some past defence models failed and how some model remained adamant and proved their soundness against some of the very strong attacks."},{"id":"2007.08911v3","title":"Technologies for Trustworthy Machine Learning: A Survey in a Socio-Technical Context","authors":"Ehsan Toreini, Mhairi Aitken, Kovila P.

In this paper we provide an overview of technologies that support building trustworthy machine learning systems, i.e., systems whose properties justify that people place trust in them. We argue that four categories of system properties are instrumental in achieving the policy objectives, namely fairness, explainability, auditability and safety & security (FEAS). We discuss how these properties need to be considered across all stages of the machine learning life cycle, from data collection through run-time model inference. As a consequence, we survey in this paper the main technologies with respect to all four of the FEAS properties, for data-centric as well as model-centric stages of the machine learning system life cycle.

Developing interactive systems capable of performing such a variety of reasoning tasks for the benefits of its users has proved difficult, notably for performance and\/or development cost reasons. Still, recently, a reasoning engine, called IDP3, has been used to build such systems, but it lacked support for arithmetic operations, seriously limiting its usefulness. We have developed a new reasoning engine, IDP-Z3, that removes this limitation, and we put it to the test in four knowledge-intensive industrial use cases.   This paper describes FO(.)

It then describes the generic reasoning tasks that IDP-Z3 can perform, and how we used them to build a generic user interface, called the Interactive Consultant. Finally, it reports on the four use cases.   In these four use cases, the interactive applications based on IDP-Z3 were capable of intelligent behavior of value to users, while having a low development cost (typically 10 days) and an acceptable response time (typically below 3 seconds).

However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in domains ranging from criminal justice and finance to healthcare. In such AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is responsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best teammate? We argue \"No\" -- predictable performance may be worth a slight sacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study this proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team's expected utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the final decision, cost of verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the benefit of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization approaches beyond well-studied loss functions such as log-loss, and encourage future work on AI optimization problems motivated by human-AI collaboration."},{"id":"2107.12806v2","title":"Towards Industrial Private AI: A two-tier framework for data and model security","authors":"Sunder Ali Khowaja, Kapal Dev, Nawab Muhammad Faseeh Qureshi, Parus Khuwaja, Luca Foschini","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.12806v2","content":"With the advances in 5G and IoT devices, the industries are vastly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for improving classification and prediction-based services.

In this regard, we propose a Federated Learning and Encryption-based Private (FLEP) AI framework that provides two-tier security for data and model parameters in an IIoT environment.

Strategic classification studies learning in settings where self-interested users can strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictive outcomes. A key working assumption, however, is that 'favorable' always means 'positive'; this may be appropriate in some applications (e.g., loan approval, university admissions and hiring), but reduces to a fairly narrow view what user interests can be. In this work we argue for a broader perspective on what accounts for strategic user behavior, and propose and study a flexible model of generalized strategic classification. Our generalized model subsumes most current models, but includes other novel settings; among these, we identify and target one intriguing sub-class of problems in which the interests of users and the system are aligned. For this cooperative setting, we provide an in-depth analysis, and propose a practical learning approach that is effective and efficient. We compare our approach to existing learning methods and show its statistical and optimization benefits. Returning to our fully generalized model, we show how our results and approach can extend to the most general case.

This is useful when one wishes to change the architecture or learning algorithm of an agent (so that the new knowledge need not be built \"from scratch\"), when new agents are frequently introduced to the environment with no knowledge, or when an agent must adapt to similar but different problems. Great progress has been made in the agent-to-agent case using the Teacher\/Student framework proposed by (Torrey and Taylor 2013). However, that approach requires that learning from a teacher be treated differently from learning in every other reinforcement learning context. In this paper, I propose a method which allows the teacher\/student framework to be applied in a way that fits directly and naturally into the more general reinforcement learning framework by integrating the teacher feedback into the reward signal received by the learning agent. I show that this approach can significantly improve the rate of learning for an agent playing a one-player stochastic game; I give examples of potential pitfalls of the approach; and I propose further areas of research building on this framework."},{"id":"1601.06245v1","title":"Artificial Persuasion in Pedagogical Games","authors":"Zhiwei Zeng","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1601.06245v1","content":"A Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is a special type of Teachable Agent which incorporates a persuasion theory in order to provide persuasive and more personalized feedback to the student. By employing the persuasion techniques, the PTA seeks to maintain the student in a high motivation and high ability state in which he or she has higher cognitive ability and his or her changes in attitudes are more persistent. However, the existing model of the PTA still has a few limitations. Firstly, the existing PTA model focuses on modelling the PTA's ability to persuade, while does not model its ability to be taught by the student and to practice the knowledge it has learnt. Secondly, the quantitative model for computational processes in the PTA has low reusability. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of the PTA.   To address these three limitations, this book proposes an improved agent model which follows a goal-oriented approach and models the PTA in its totality by integrating the Persuasion Reasoning of the PTA with the Teachability Reasoning and the Practicability Reasoning. The project also proposes a more abstract and generalized quantitative model for the computations in the PTA. With higher level of abstraction, the reusability of the quantitative model is also improved.

We present an AGI safety layer that creates a special dedicated input terminal to support the iterative improvement of an AGI agent's utility function. The humans who switched on the agent can use this terminal to close any loopholes that are discovered in the utility function's encoding of agent goals and constraints, to direct the agent towards new goals, or to force the agent to switch itself off. An AGI agent may develop the emergent incentive to manipulate the above utility function improvement process, for example by deceiving, restraining, or even attacking the humans involved. The safety layer will partially, and sometimes fully, suppress this dangerous incentive. The first part of this paper generalizes earlier work on AGI emergency stop buttons. We aim to make the mathematical methods used to construct the layer more accessible, by applying them to an MDP model. We discuss two provable properties of the safety layer, and show ongoing work in mapping it to a Causal Influence Diagram (CID). In the second part, we develop full mathematical proofs, and show that the safety layer creates a type of bureaucratic blindness. We then present the design of a learning agent, a design that wraps the safety layer around either a known machine learning system, or a potential future AGI-level learning system. The resulting agent will satisfy the provable safety properties from the moment it is first switched on. Finally, we show how this agent can be mapped from its model to a real-life implementation. We review the methodological issues involved in this step, and discuss how these are typically resolved."},{"id":"2005.01908v1","title":"A multi-component framework for the analysis and design of explainable artificial intelligence","authors":"S.

We discuss which requirements a shield must meet to preserve the convergence guarantees of the learner.

To approach this, we draw inspiration from human cognitive biases -- systematic patterns of deviation from rational judgement. Specifically, we use cognitive biases to (i) identify inputs that models are likely to err on, and (ii) develop tests to qualitatively characterize their errors on these inputs. Using code generation as a case study, we find that OpenAI's Codex errs predictably based on how the input prompt is framed, adjusts outputs towards anchors, and is biased towards outputs that mimic frequent training examples. We then use our framework to uncover high-impact errors such as incorrectly deleting files.

Such technological developments from AI-labs have ushered concomitant applications across the world of business - where an AI brand tag is fast becoming ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when AI gets things wrong - an autonomous vehicle crashes; a chatbot exhibits racist behaviour; automated credit scoring processes discriminate on gender etc. - there are often significant financial, legal and brand consequences and the incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for such mistakes is that, 'all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting'. The key, Judea Pearl suggests, is to replace reasoning by association with causal-reasoning - the ability to infer causes from observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: 'we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets - often using an approach known as Deep Learning - and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality'.

We define an abstraction to be a small set of `summaries' of a system which can be used to answer a set of queries about the system or its behaviour. The difference between the ground truth behaviour of the system on the queries and the behaviour of the system predicted only by the abstraction provides a measure of the `leakiness' of the abstraction which can be used as a loss function to directly learn abstractions from data. Our approach can be considered a generalization of classical statistics where we are not interested in reconstructing `the data' in full, but are instead only concerned with answering a set of arbitrary queries about the data.

We test these methods on a popular Atari game (Montezuma's Revenge) and variants of Sokoban (a well-known planning benchmark) and report the results of user studies to evaluate whether people find explanations generated in this form useful."},{"id":"1304.2376v1","title":"Generating Decision Structures and Causal Explanations for Decision Making","authors":"Spencer Star","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1304.2376v1","content":"This paper examines two related problems that are central to developing an autonomous decision-making agent, such as a robot. Both problems require generating structured representafions from a database of unstructured declarative knowledge that includes many facts and rules that are irrelevant in the problem context. The first problem is how to generate a well structured decision problem from such a database. The second problem is how to generate, from the same database, a well-structured explanation of why some possible world occurred. In this paper it is shown that the problem of generating the appropriate decision structure or explanation is intractable without introducing further constraints on the knowledge in the database. The paper proposes that the problem search space can be constrained by adding knowledge to the database about causal relafions between events. In order to determine the causal knowledge that would be most useful, causal theories for deterministic and indeterministic universes are proposed. A program that uses some of these causal constraints has been used to generate explanations about faulty plans. The program shows the expected increase in efficiency as the causal constraints are introduced."},{"id":"2004.01056v1","title":"Improving Confidence in the Estimation of Values and Norms","authors":"Luciano Cavalcante Siebert, Rijk Mercuur, Virginia Dignum, Jeroen van den Hoven, Catholijn Jonker","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.01056v1","content":"Autonomous agents (AA) will increasingly be interacting with us in our daily lives. While we want the benefits attached to AAs, it is essential that their behavior is aligned with our values and norms. Hence, an AA will need to estimate the values and norms of the humans it interacts with, which is not a straightforward task when solely observing an agent's behavior. This paper analyses to what extent an AA is able to estimate the values and norms of a simulated human agent (SHA) based on its actions in the ultimatum game. We present two methods to reduce ambiguity in profiling the SHAs: one based on search space exploration and another based on counterfactual analysis. We found that both methods are able to increase the confidence in estimating human values and norms, but differ in their applicability, the latter being more efficient when the number of interactions with the agent is to be minimized. These insights are useful to improve the alignment of AAs with human values and norms."},{"id":"2112.13404v1","title":"Abstractions of General Reinforcement Learning","authors":"Sultan J.

Unlike the agents in traditional AI, the agents in artificial general intelligence (AGI) are required to replicate human intelligence in almost every domain of interest. Moreover, an AGI agent should be able to achieve this without (virtually any) further changes, retraining, or fine-tuning of the parameters. The real world is non-stationary, non-ergodic, and non-Markovian: we, humans, can neither revisit our past nor are the most recent observations sufficient statistics. Yet, we excel at a variety of complex tasks. Many of these tasks require longterm planning. We can associate this success to our natural faculty to abstract away task-irrelevant information from our overwhelming sensory experience. We make task-specific mental models of the world without much effort. Due to this ability to abstract, we can plan on a significantly compact representation of a task without much loss of performance. Not only this, we also abstract our actions to produce high-level plans: the level of action-abstraction can be anywhere between small muscle movements to a mental notion of \"doing an action\". It is natural to assume that any AGI agent competing with humans (at every plausible domain) should also have these abilities to abstract its experiences and actions. This thesis is an inquiry into the existence of such abstractions which aid efficient planing for a wide range of domains, and most importantly, these abstractions come with some optimality guarantees."},{"id":"1110.6437v3","title":"Anthropic decision theory","authors":"Stuart Armstrong","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1110.6437v3","content":"This paper sets out to resolve how agents ought to act in the Sleeping Beauty problem and various related anthropic (self-locating belief) problems, not through the calculation of anthropic probabilities, but through finding the correct decision to make.

By doing so, it demonstrates that the attitude of agents with regards to each other (selfish or altruistic) changes the decisions they reach, and that it is very important to take this into account.

The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process.

It is agreed that this is due to the recently revived Deep Learning technology. Deep Learning enables to process large amounts of data using simplified neuron networks that simulate the way in which the brain works. However, there is a different point of view, which posits that the brain is processing information, not data. This unresolved duality hampered AI progress for years. In this paper, I propose a notion of Integrated information that hopefully will resolve the problem. I consider integrated information as a coupling between two separate entities - physical information (that implies data processing) and semantic information (that provides physical information interpretation). In this regard, intelligence becomes a product of information processing. Extending further this line of thinking, it can be said that information processing does not require more a human brain for its implementation. Indeed, bacteria and amoebas exhibit intelligent behavior without any sign of a brain. That dramatically removes the need for AI systems to emulate the human brain complexity!

Researchers have worked hard trying to automate many components of the pipeline. However, one key component of the pipeline--problem definition--is still left mostly unexplored in terms of automation. Usually, it requires extensive efforts from domain experts to identify, define and formulate important problems in an area. However, automatically discovering research or application problems for an area is beneficial since it helps to identify valid and potentially important problems hidden in data that are unknown to domain experts, expand the scope of tasks that we can do in an area, and even inspire completely new findings.   This paper describes Problem Learning, which aims at learning to discover and define valid and ethical problems from data or from the machine's interaction with the environment. We formalize problem learning as the identification of valid and ethical problems in a problem space and introduce several possible approaches to problem learning. In a broader sense, problem learning is an approach towards the free will of intelligent machines. Currently, machines are still limited to solving the problems defined by humans, without the ability or flexibility to freely explore various possible problems that are even unknown to humans. Though many machine learning techniques have been developed and integrated into intelligent systems, they still focus on the means rather than the purpose in that machines are still solving human defined problems. However, proposing good problems is sometimes even more important than solving problems, because a good problem can help to inspire new ideas and gain deeper understandings.

On the other hand, offline data about the behavior of the assisted agent might be available, but is non-trivial to take advantage of by methods such as offline reinforcement learning. We introduce methods where the capability to create a representation of the behavior is first pre-trained with offline data, after which only a small amount of interaction data is needed to learn an assisting policy.

Here, a logical charaacterization of iterated admisibility is given that involves only standard probability and holds in all structures, not just complete structures. A stronger notion of strong admissibility is then defined. Roughly speaking, strong admissibility is meant to capture the intuition that \"all the agent knows\" is that the other agents satisfy the appropriate rationality assumptions.

It is tentatively proposed that the core of Atomese 2.0 should be a very flexible framework of rewriting rules for rewriting a metagraph (where the rules themselves are represented within the same metagraph, and some of the intermediate data created and used during the rule-interpretation process may be represented in the same metagraph). This framework should support concurrent rewriting of the metagraph according to rules that are labeled with various sorts of uncertainty-quantifications, and that are labeled with various sorts of types associated with various type systems. A gradual typing approach should be used to enable mixture of rules and other metagraph nodes\/links associated with various type systems, and untyped metagraph nodes\/links not associated with any type system. This must be done in a way that allows reasonable efficiency and scalability, including in concurrent and distributed processing contexts, in the case where a large percentage of of processing time is occupied with evaluating static pattern-matching queries on specific subgraphs of a large metagraph (including a rich variety of queries such as matches against nodes representing variables, and matches against whole subgraphs, etc.)."},{"id":"1810.11116v1","title":"Mimetic vs Anchored Value Alignment in Artificial Intelligence","authors":"Tae Wan Kim, Thomas Donaldson, John Hooker","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.11116v1","content":"\"Value alignment\" (VA) is considered as one of the top priorities in AI research.

The paper begins by isolating two distinct forms of VA: \"mimetic\" and \"anchored.\" Then it discusses which VA approach better avoids the naturalistic fallacy. The discussion reveals stumbling blocks for VA approaches that neglect implications of the naturalistic fallacy.

New applications of AI across societal domains and public organizations and infrastructures come with new hazards, which lead to new forms of harm, both grave and pernicious. The text addresses the lack of consensus for diagnosing and eliminating new AI system hazards. For decades, the field of system safety has dealt with accidents and harm in safety-critical systems governed by varying degrees of software-based automation and decision-making. This field embraces the core assumption of systems and control that AI systems cannot be safeguarded by technical design choices on the model or algorithm alone, instead requiring an end-to-end hazard analysis and design frame that includes the context of use, impacted stakeholders and the formal and informal institutional environment in which the system operates. Safety and other values are then inherently socio-technical and emergent system properties that require design and control measures to instantiate these across the technical, social and institutional components of a system. This chapter honors system safety pioneer Nancy Leveson, by situating her core lessons for today's AI system safety challenges. For every lesson, concrete tools are offered for rethinking and reorganizing the safety management of AI systems, both in design and governance. This history tells us that effective AI safety management requires transdisciplinary approaches and a shared language that allows involvement of all levels of society."},{"id":"2109.06740v1","title":"Deceptive Decision-Making Under Uncertainty","authors":"Yagiz Savas, Christos K.

The agent has an incentive to try to deceive the adversary about its intentions, while at the same time working to achieve its objective. The primary contribution of this paper is to introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for the notion of deception within the context of optimal control. The central notion introduced in the paper is that of a belief-induced reward: a reward dependent not only on the agent's state and action, but also adversary's beliefs. Design of an optimal deceptive strategy then becomes a question of optimal control design on the product of the agent's state space and the adversary's belief space. The proposed framework allows for deception to be defined in an arbitrary control system endowed with a reward function, as well as with additional specifications limiting the agent's control policy. In addition to defining deception, we discuss design of optimally deceptive strategies under uncertainties in agent's knowledge about the adversary's learning process. In the latter part of the paper, we focus on a setting where the agent's behavior is governed by a Markov decision process, and show that the design of optimally deceptive strategies under lack of knowledge about the adversary naturally reduces to previously discussed problems in control design on partially observable or uncertain Markov decision processes. Finally, we present two examples of deceptive strategies: a \"cops and robbers\" scenario and an example where an agent may use camouflage while moving. We show that optimally deceptive strategies in such examples follow the intuitive idea of how to deceive an adversary in the above settings."},{"id":"2012.11705v1","title":"Taking Principles Seriously: A Hybrid Approach to Value Alignment","authors":"Tae Wan Kim, John Hooker, Thomas Donaldson","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2012.11705v1","content":"An important step in the development of value alignment (VA) systems in AI is understanding how VA can reflect valid ethical principles.

Using quantified model logic, we precisely formulate principles derived from deontological ethics and show how they imply particular \"test propositions\" for any given action plan in an AI rule base. The action plan is ethical only if the test proposition is empirically true, a judgment that is made on the basis of empirical VA.

However, if AI is to improve people's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to understand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often seen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be possible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates within set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs and outputs. We place a \"glass box\" around the system by mapping moral values into explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way that if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to the value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and comparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks to agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values into concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability; stakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant abstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by operating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with different interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an impact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and providing them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values."},{"id":"1605.04232v2","title":"Review of state-of-the-arts in artificial intelligence with application to AI safety problem","authors":"Vladimir Shakirov","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1605.04232v2","content":"Here, I review current state-of-the-arts in many areas of AI to estimate when it's reasonable to expect human level AI development.

However, the way to select a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear. Most work in AI adopts classical game-theoretic equilibrium analysis to predict agent behavior in such settings. This approach however does not provide us with any guarantee for the agent. In this paper we introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap between the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium analysis. We show that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee the value obtained in a Nash equilibrium, in several classical computer science settings. Then, we discuss the concept of competitive safety strategies, and illustrate its use in a decentralized load balancing setting, typical to network problems. In particular, we show that when we have many agents, it is possible to guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of 8\/9 of the payoff obtained in a Nash equilibrium. Our discussion of competitive safety analysis for decentralized load balancing is further developed to deal with many communication links and arbitrary speeds. Finally, we discuss the extension of the above concepts to Bayesian games, and illustrate their use in a basic auctions setup."},{"id":"1906.05833v2","title":"There is no Artificial General Intelligence","authors":"J.

One common theme in these discussions is the thesis that the ability of a machine to conduct convincing dialogues with human beings can serve as at least a sufficient criterion of AGI. We argue that this very ability should be accepted also as a necessary condition of AGI, and we provide a description of the nature of human dialogue in particular and of human language in general against this background. We then argue that it is for mathematical reasons impossible to program a machine in such a way that it could master human dialogue behaviour in its full generality. This is (1) because there are no traditional explicitly designed mathematical models that could be used as a starting point for creating such programs; and (2) because even the sorts of automated models generated by using machine learning, which have been used successfully in areas such as machine translation, cannot be extended to cope with human dialogue. If this is so, then we can conclude that a Turing machine also cannot possess AGI, because it fails to fulfil a necessary condition thereof.

Elton","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2002.05149v6","content":"The ability to explain decisions made by AI systems is highly sought after, especially in domains where human lives are at stake such as medicine or autonomous vehicles. While it is often possible to approximate the input-output relations of deep neural networks with a few human-understandable rules, the discovery of the double descent phenomena suggests that such approximations do not accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double descent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly interpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level rules. As a result, neural networks trained on complex real world data are inherently hard to interpret and prone to failure if asked to extrapolate. To show how we might be able to trust AI despite these problems we introduce the concept of self-explaining AI. Self-explaining AIs are capable of providing a human-understandable explanation of each decision along with confidence levels for both the decision and explanation. For this approach to work, it is important that the explanation actually be related to the decision, ideally capturing the mechanism used to arrive at the explanation. Finally, we argue it is important that deep learning based systems include a \"warning light\" based on techniques from applicability domain analysis to warn the user if a model is asked to extrapolate outside its training distribution.

From the combination of both developments emerges the field of AI ethics which recognizes that the actions of autonomous machines entail moral dimensions and tries to answer the question of how we can build moral machines. In this paper we argue for taking inspiration from Aristotelian virtue ethics by showing that it forms a suitable combination with modern AI due to its focus on learning from experience. We furthermore propose that imitation learning from moral exemplars, a central concept in virtue ethics, can solve the value alignment problem.

However, no final consensus on the design of ethical utility functions facilitating AI value alignment has been achieved yet. Given the urgency to identify systematic solutions, we postulate that it might be useful to start with the simple fact that for the utility function of an AI not to violate human ethical intuitions, it trivially has to be a model of these intuitions and reflect their variety $ - $ whereby the most accurate models pertaining to human entities being biological organisms equipped with a brain constructing concepts like moral judgements, are scientific models. Thus, in order to better assess the variety of human morality, we perform a transdisciplinary analysis applying a security mindset to the issue and summarizing variety-relevant background knowledge from neuroscience and psychology. We complement this information by linking it to augmented utilitarianism as a suitable ethical framework. Based on that, we propose first practical guidelines for the design of approximate ethical goal functions that might better capture the variety of human moral judgements.

The first, initiated by Rubinstein, charges an agent for doing costly computation; the second, initiated by Neyman, does not charge for computation, but limits the computation that agents can do, typically by modeling agents as finite automata. We review recent work on applying both approaches in the context of decision theory. For the first approach, we take the objects of choice in a decision problem to be Turing machines, and charge players for the ``complexity'' of the Turing machine chosen (e.g., its running time). This approach can be used to explain well-known phenomena like first-impression-matters biases (i.e., people tend to put more weight on evidence they hear early on) and belief polarization (two people with different prior beliefs, hearing the same evidence, can end up with diametrically opposed conclusions) as the outcomes of quite rational decisions. For the second approach, we model people as finite automata, and provide a simple algorithm that, on a problem that captures a number of settings of interest, provably performs optimally as the number of states in the automaton increases."},{"id":"1910.00584v1","title":"CWAE-IRL: Formulating a supervised approach to Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem","authors":"Arpan Kusari","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.00584v1","content":"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to infer the reward function from the actions of an expert running a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Using this technique, the intractable posterior distribution of the continuous latent variable (the reward function in this case) is analytically approximated to appear to be as close to the prior belief while trying to reconstruct the future state conditioned on the current state and action. The reward function is derived using a well-known deep generative model known as Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE) with Wasserstein loss function, thus referred to as Conditional Wasserstein Auto-encoder-IRL (CWAE-IRL), which can be analyzed as a combination of the backward and forward inference.

This paper explores the analogy between these two complex systems, and we suggest that a clearer understanding of this apparent analogy may help us forward in both the socio-economic domain and the AI domain: known results in economics may help inform feasible solutions in AI safety, but also known results in AI may inform economic policy.

In particular, it introduces U-Plan, a planning system that constructs quantitatively ranked plans given an incomplete description of the state of the world. U-Plan uses a DempsterShafer interval to characterise uncertain and incomplete information about the state of the world. The planner takes as input what is known about the world, and constructs a number of possible initial states with representations at different abstraction levels. A plan is constructed for the initial state with the greatest support, and this plan is tested to see if it will work for other possible initial states. All, part, or none of the existing plans may be used in the generation of the plans for the remaining possible worlds. Planning takes place in an abstraction hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. A super-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and the appropriately timed acquisition of essential knowledge, which is used to decide between plan alternatives. U-Plan usually produces a super-plan in less time than a classical planner would take to produce a set of plans, one for each possible world."},{"id":"2111.09884v1","title":"Assisted Robust Reward Design","authors":"Jerry Zhi-Yang He, Anca D.

When we define the problem the robot needs to solve, we pretend that a designer specifies this complex reward exactly, and it is set in stone from then on. In practice, however, reward design is an iterative process: the designer chooses a reward, eventually encounters an \"edge-case\" environment where the reward incentivizes the wrong behavior, revises the reward, and repeats. What would it mean to rethink robotics problems to formally account for this iterative nature of reward design? We propose that the robot not take the specified reward for granted, but rather have uncertainty about it, and account for the future design iterations as future evidence. We contribute an Assisted Reward Design method that speeds up the design process by anticipating and influencing this future evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually encounter failure cases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes the designer to such environments during the development phase. We test this method in a simplified autonomous driving task and find that it more quickly improves the car's behavior in held-out environments by proposing environments that are \"edge cases\" for the current reward."},{"id":"1007.0940v1","title":"An axiomatic formalization of bounded rationality based on a utility-information equivalence","authors":"Pedro A.

Here we propose an axiomatic framework for bounded decision-making that considers resource costs. Agents are formalized as probability measures over input-output streams. We postulate that any such probability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function based on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic mappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique conversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information). Moreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational principle: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure maximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures can then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new constraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a criterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a target utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference distribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive control problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When resource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our formalization might thus provide a principled approach to bounded rationality that establishes a close link to information theory."},{"id":"2002.02526v1","title":"How to Answer Why -- Evaluating the Explanations of AI Through Mental Model Analysis","authors":"Tim Schrills, Thomas Franke","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2002.02526v1","content":"To achieve optimal human-system integration in the context of user-AI interaction it is important that users develop a valid representation of how AI works.

If no explicit explanations are provided by a system (e.g. by a self-explaining AI) or other sources (e.g. an instructor), the mental model is typically formed based on experiences, i.e. the observations of the user during the interaction. The congruence of this mental model and the actual systems functioning is vital, as it is used for assumptions, predictions and consequently for decisions regarding system use. A key question for human-centered AI research is therefore how to validly survey users' mental models. The objective of the present research is to identify suitable elicitation methods for mental model analysis. We evaluated whether mental models are suitable as an empirical research method.

This paper explores the possibility of safe RL algorithms with zero training-time safety violations in the challenging setting where we are only given a safe but trivial-reward initial policy without any prior knowledge of the dynamics model and additional offline data. We propose an algorithm, Co-trained Barrier Certificate for Safe RL (CRABS), which iteratively learns barrier certificates, dynamics models, and policies. The barrier certificates, learned via adversarial training, ensure the policy's safety assuming calibrated learned dynamics model. We also add a regularization term to encourage larger certified regions to enable better exploration. Empirical simulations show that zero safety violations are already challenging for a suite of simple environments with only 2-4 dimensional state space, especially if high-reward policies have to visit regions near the safety boundary. Prior methods require hundreds of violations to achieve decent rewards on these tasks, whereas our proposed algorithms incur zero violations."},{"id":"1102.2738v1","title":"Decision Theory with Prospect Interference and Entanglement","authors":"V.

This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions, which allows us to describe a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real human beings. The theory characterizes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle, known as the disjunction effect, can be explained quantitatively as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The disjunction effects, observed in experiments, are accurately predicted using a theorem on interference alternation that we derive, which connects aversion-to-uncertainty to the appearance of negative interference terms suppressing the probability of actions. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms. A series of experiments are analysed and shown to be in excellent agreement with a priori evaluation of interference effects. The conjunction fallacy is also shown to be a sufficient condition for the disjunction effect and novel experiments testing the combined interplay between the two effects are suggested."},{"id":"2008.12879v2","title":"A Metamodel and Framework for AGI","authors":"Hugo Latapie, Ozkan Kilic","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2008.12879v2","content":"Can artificial intelligence systems exhibit superhuman performance, but in critical ways, lack the intelligence of even a single-celled organism? The answer is clearly 'yes' for narrow AI systems. Animals, plants, and even single-celled organisms learn to reliably avoid danger and move towards food. This is accomplished via a physical knowledge preserving metamodel that autonomously generates useful models of the world. We posit that preserving the structure of knowledge is critical for higher intelligences that manage increasingly higher levels of abstraction, be they human or artificial. This is the key lesson learned from applying AGI subsystems to complex real-world problems that require continuous learning and adaptation. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Fusion Reasoning Engine (DFRE), which implements a knowledge-preserving metamodel and framework for constructing applied AGI systems. The DFRE metamodel exhibits some important fundamental knowledge preserving properties such as clear distinctions between symmetric and antisymmetric relations, and the ability to create a hierarchical knowledge representation that clearly delineates between levels of abstraction. The DFRE metamodel, which incorporates these capabilities, demonstrates how this approach benefits AGI in specific ways such as managing combinatorial explosion and enabling cumulative, distributed and federated learning. Our experiments show that the proposed framework achieves 94% accuracy on average on unsupervised object detection and recognition.

However, for AI to progress to more complicated tasks requiring intuition and empathy, it must develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy akin to human self-awareness or consciousness. We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible only through a fundamental shift in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, a shift similar to what took place for humans through the process of natural selection and evolution. As such, this paper aims to theoretically explore the requirements for the emergence of consciousness in AI. It also provides a principled understanding of how conscious AI can be detected and how it might be manifested in contrast to the dominant paradigm that seeks to ultimately create machines that are linguistically indistinguishable from humans."},{"id":"1908.01695v2","title":"Corrigibility with Utility Preservation","authors":"Koen Holtman","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1908.01695v2","content":"Corrigibility is a safety property for artificially intelligent agents.

The layer counter-acts the emergent incentive of advanced agents to resist such alteration. A detailed model for agents which can reason about preserving their utility function is developed, and used to prove that the corrigibility layer works as intended in a large set of non-hostile universes. The corrigible agents have an emergent incentive to protect key elements of their corrigibility layer. However, hostile universes may contain forces strong enough to break safety features. Some open problems related to graceful degradation when an agent is successfully attacked are identified.

For example, usability testing can help determine if the audience understands how the AI system works and complies with the HMT Framework. The HMT Framework is based on reviews of existing ethical codes and best practices in human-computer interaction and software development.

Brain-inspired AGI development, in other words, cutting down the design space to look more like a biological brain, which is an existing model of a general intelligence, is a promising plan for solving this problem. However, it is difficult for an individual to design a software program that corresponds to the entire brain because the neuroscientific data required to understand the architecture of the brain are extensive and complicated. The whole-brain architecture approach divides the brain-inspired AGI development process into the task of designing the brain reference architecture (BRA) -- the flow of information and the diagram of corresponding components -- and the task of developing each component using the BRA. This is called BRA-driven development. Another difficulty lies in the extraction of the operating principles necessary for reproducing the cognitive-behavioral function of the brain from neuroscience data. Therefore, this study proposes the Structure-constrained Interface Decomposition (SCID) method, which is a hypothesis-building method for creating a hypothetical component diagram consistent with neuroscientific findings. The application of this approach has begun for building various regions of the brain. Moving forward, we will examine methods of evaluating the biological plausibility of brain-inspired software.

Another usage, referring to a class of systems which may be useful for addressing the value alignment and AI control problems, is a superintelligent AI system that only answers questions. The aim of this manuscript is to survey contemporary research problems related to oracles which align with long-term research goals of AI safety. We examine existing question answering systems and argue that their high degree of architectural heterogeneity makes them poor candidates for rigorous analysis as oracles. On the other hand, we identify computer algebra systems (CASs) as being primitive examples of domain-specific oracles for mathematics and argue that efforts to integrate computer algebra systems with theorem provers, systems which have largely been developed independent of one another, provide a concrete set of problems related to the notion of provable safety that has emerged in the AI safety community. We review approaches to interfacing CASs with theorem provers, describe well-defined architectural deficiencies that have been identified with CASs, and suggest possible lines of research and practical software projects for scientists interested in AI safety."},{"id":"2111.14766v1","title":"Mesarovician Abstract Learning Systems","authors":"Tyler Cody","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2111.14766v1","content":"The solution methods used to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI) may not contain the formalism needed to adequately model and characterize AGI. In particular, current approaches to learning hold notions of problem domain and problem task as fundamental precepts, but it is hardly apparent that an AGI encountered in the wild will be discernable into a set of domain-task pairings. Nor is it apparent that the outcomes of AGI in a system can be well expressed in terms of domain and task, or as consequences thereof. Thus, there is both a practical and theoretical use for meta-theories of learning which do not express themselves explicitly in terms of solution methods. General systems theory offers such a meta-theory. Herein, Mesarovician abstract systems theory is used as a super-structure for learning. Abstract learning systems are formulated. Subsequent elaboration stratifies the assumptions of learning systems into a hierarchy and considers the hierarchy such stratification projects onto learning theory. The presented Mesarovician abstract learning systems theory calls back to the founding motivations of artificial intelligence research by focusing on the thinking participants directly, in this case, learning systems, in contrast to the contemporary focus on the problems thinking participants solve."},{"id":"2202.03153v1","title":"Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence: An Analysis","authors":"Soumil Rathi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.03153v1","content":"This paper is an analysis of the different methods proposed to achieve AGI, including Human Brain Emulation, AIXI and Integrated Cognitive Architecture. First, the definition of AGI as used in this paper has been defined, and its requirements have been stated. For each proposed method mentioned, the method in question was summarized and its key processes were detailed, showcasing how it functioned. Then, each method listed was analyzed, taking various factors into consideration, such as technological requirements, computational ability, and adequacy to the requirements. It was concluded that while there are various methods to achieve AGI that could work, such as Human Brain Emulation and Integrated Cognitive Architectures, the most promising method to achieve AGI is Integrated Cognitive Architectures. This is because Human Brain Emulation was found to require scanning technologies that will most likely not be available until the 2030s, making it unlikely to be created before then. Moreover, Integrated Cognitive Architectures has reduced computational requirements and a suitable functionality for General Intelligence, making it the most likely way to achieve AGI."},{"id":"1906.06436v1","title":"Towards Empathetic Planning","authors":"Maayan Shvo, Sheila A.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly required to interact with humans in a myriad of settings, it is important to enable AI to wield empathy as a tool to benefit those it interacts with. In this paper, we work towards this goal by bringing together a number of important concepts: empathy, AI planning, and reasoning in the presence of knowledge and belief. We formalize the notion of Empathetic Planning which is informed by the beliefs and affective state of the empathizee. We appeal to an epistemic logic framework to represent the beliefs of the empathizee and propose AI planning-based computational approaches to compute empathetic solutions. We illustrate the potential benefits of our approach by conducting a study where we evaluate participants' perceptions of the agent's empathetic abilities and assistive capabilities."},{"id":"1704.00783v2","title":"Brief Notes on Hard Takeoff, Value Alignment, and Coherent Extrapolated Volition","authors":"Gopal P.

In this context, one preeminent challenge that has been addressed by multiple researchers is the adequate formulation of utility functions or equivalents reliably capturing human ethical conceptions. However, the specification of suitable utility functions harbors the risk of \"perverse instantiation\" for which no final consensus on responsible proactive countermeasures has been achieved so far. Amidst this background, we propose a novel socio-technological ethical framework denoted Augmented Utilitarianism which directly alleviates the perverse instantiation problem. We elaborate on how augmented by AI and more generally science and technology, it might allow a society to craft and update ethical utility functions while jointly undergoing a dynamical ethical enhancement. Further, we elucidate the need to consider embodied simulations in the design of utility functions for AGIs aligned with human values. Finally, we discuss future prospects regarding the usage of the presented scientifically grounded ethical framework and mention possible challenges."},{"id":"1803.02765v1","title":"Realizing Intelligence","authors":"Paul Yaworsky","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.02765v1","content":"Order exists in the world.

This idea was criticized by Hume and others as untenable leading to the famous problem of induction. It wasn't until the work of Karl Popper that this problem was solved, by demonstrating that induction is not the basis for science and that the development of scientific knowledge is instead based on the same principles as biological evolution. Today, machine learning is also taught as being rooted in induction from big data. Solomonoff induction implemented in an idealized Bayesian agent (Hutter's AIXI) is widely discussed and touted as a framework for understanding AI algorithms, even though real-world attempts to implement something like AIXI immediately encounter fatal problems. In this paper, we contrast frameworks based on induction with Donald T. Campbell's universal Darwinism. We show that most AI algorithms in use today can be understood as using an evolutionary trial and error process searching over a solution space. In this work we argue that a universal Darwinian framework provides a better foundation for understanding AI systems. Moreover, at a more meta level the process of development of all AI algorithms can be understood under the framework of universal Darwinism."},{"id":"2011.06665v1","title":"Domain-Level Explainability -- A Challenge for Creating Trust in Superhuman AI Strategies","authors":"Jonas Andrulis, Ole Meyer, Gr\u00e9gory Schott, Samuel Weinbach, Volker Gruhn","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2011.06665v1","content":"For strategic problems, intelligent systems based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated an impressive ability to learn advanced solutions that can go far beyond human capabilities, especially when dealing with complex scenarios.

With superhuman strategies being non-intuitive and complex by definition and real-world scenarios prohibiting a reliable performance evaluation, the key components for trust in these systems are difficult to achieve. Explainable AI (XAI) has successfully increased transparency for modern AI systems through a variety of measures, however, XAI research has not yet provided approaches enabling domain level insights for expert users in strategic situations.

The right explanation provides the rationale behind an AI agent's decision-making. However, to maintain the human teammate's cognitive demand to comprehend the provided explanations, prior works have focused on providing explanations in a specific order or intertwining the explanation generation with plan execution. Moreover, these approaches do not consider the degree of details required to share throughout the provided explanations. In this work, we argue that the agent-generated explanations, especially the complex ones, should be abstracted to be aligned with the level of details the human teammate desires to maintain the recipient's cognitive load. Therefore, learning a hierarchical explanations model is a challenging task. Moreover, the agent needs to follow a consistent high-level policy to transfer the learned teammate preferences to a new scenario while lower-level detailed plans are different. Our evaluation confirmed the process of understanding an explanation, especially a complex and detailed explanation, is hierarchical. The human preference that reflected this aspect corresponded exactly to creating and employing abstraction for knowledge assimilation hidden deeper in our cognitive process. We showed that hierarchical explanations achieved better task performance and behavior interpretability while reduced cognitive load. These results shed light on designing explainable agents utilizing reinforcement learning and planning across various domains."},{"id":"2102.03022v1","title":"Deceptive Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving Planning","authors":"Zhengshang Liu, Yue Yang, Tim Miller, Peta Masters","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2102.03022v1","content":"In this paper, we study the problem of deceptive reinforcement learning to preserve the privacy of a reward function. Reinforcement learning is the problem of finding a behaviour policy based on rewards received from exploratory behaviour. A key ingredient in reinforcement learning is a reward function, which determines how much reward (negative or positive) is given and when. However, in some situations, we may want to keep a reward function private; that is, to make it difficult for an observer to determine the reward function used. We define the problem of privacy-preserving reinforcement learning, and present two models for solving it. These models are based on dissimulation -- a form of deception that `hides the truth'. We evaluate our models both computationally and via human behavioural experiments. Results show that the resulting policies are indeed deceptive, and that participants can determine the true reward function less reliably than that of an honest agent."},{"id":"2111.01124v1","title":"When Does Contrastive Learning Preserve Adversarial Robustness from Pretraining to Finetuning?","authors":"Lijie Fan, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen, Gaoyuan Zhang, Chuang Gan","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2111.01124v1","content":"Contrastive learning (CL) can learn generalizable feature representations and achieve the state-of-the-art performance of downstream tasks by finetuning a linear classifier on top of it. However, as adversarial robustness becomes vital in image classification, it remains unclear whether or not CL is able to preserve robustness to downstream tasks. The main challenge is that in the self-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning paradigm, adversarial robustness is easily forgotten due to a learning task mismatch from pretraining to finetuning. We call such a challenge 'cross-task robustness transferability'. To address the above problem, in this paper we revisit and advance CL principles through the lens of robustness enhancement. We show that (1) the design of contrastive views matters: High-frequency components of images are beneficial to improving model robustness; (2) Augmenting CL with pseudo-supervision stimulus (e.g., resorting to feature clustering) helps preserve robustness without forgetting. Equipped with our new designs, we propose AdvCL, a novel adversarial contrastive pretraining framework. We show that AdvCL is able to enhance cross-task robustness transferability without loss of model accuracy and finetuning efficiency. With a thorough experimental study, we demonstrate that AdvCL outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised robust learning methods across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10) and finetuning schemes (linear evaluation and full model finetuning)."},{"id":"1806.02308v1","title":"Model-free, Model-based, and General Intelligence","authors":"Hector Geffner","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1806.02308v1","content":"During the 60s and 70s, AI researchers explored intuitions about intelligence by writing programs that displayed intelligent behavior.

The learning approach has achieved considerable success but results in black boxes that do not have the flexibility, transparency, and generality of their model-based counterparts. Model-based approaches, on the other hand, require models and scalable algorithms. Model-free learners and model-based solvers have close parallels with Systems 1 and 2 in current theories of the human mind: the first, a fast, opaque, and inflexible intuitive mind; the second, a slow, transparent, and flexible analytical mind.

Rational decision making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete as well as some intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make decisions. In the theory of bounded rationality this decision is made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect and the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations.

As opposed to the extensive literature on facility location which considers the multiplicative error, we focus on minimizing the worst-case additive error. Minimizing the additive error incentivizes mechanisms to adapt to the size of the instance. I.e., mechanisms can sacrifice little efficiency in small instances (location profiles in which all agents are relatively close to one another), in order to gain more [absolute] efficiency in large instances. We argue that this measure is better suited for many manifestations of the facility location problem in various domains.

Inspired by that individuality is of being an individual separate from others, we propose a simple yet efficient method for the emergence of individuality (EOI) in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). EOI learns a probabilistic classifier that predicts a probability distribution over agents given their observation and gives each agent an intrinsic reward of being correctly predicted by the classifier. The intrinsic reward encourages the agents to visit their own familiar observations, and learning the classifier by such observations makes the intrinsic reward signals stronger and the agents more identifiable. To further enhance the intrinsic reward and promote the emergence of individuality, two regularizers are proposed to increase the discriminability of the classifier. We implement EOI on top of popular MARL algorithms. Empirically, we show that EOI significantly outperforms existing methods in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios."},{"id":"2107.07045v1","title":"Explainable AI: current status and future directions","authors":"Prashant Gohel, Priyanka Singh, Manoranjan Mohanty","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.07045v1","content":"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In turn, a challenge for such frameworks is how to effectively couple RL with the safety layer to improve the learning performance. In the context of leveraging control barrier functions for safe RL training, prior work focuses on a restricted class of barrier functions and utilizes an auxiliary neural net to account for the effects of the safety layer which inherently results in an approximation. In this paper, we frame safety as a differentiable robust-control-barrier-function layer in a model-based RL framework.

These might enable solutions to some long-standing questions in the form of formalizing theories in the framework of constraint satisfaction without committing to one option. We strongly believe this to be the most prudent approach to long-term AI safety initiatives. In this paper, we have categorized impossibility theorems applicable to AI into five mechanism-based categories: deduction, indistinguishability, induction, tradeoffs, and intractability. We found that certain theorems are too specific or have implicit assumptions that limit application. Also, we added new results (theorems) such as the unfairness of explainability, the first explainability-related result in the induction category. The remaining results deal with misalignment between the clones and put a limit to the self-awareness of agents. We concluded that deductive impossibilities deny 100%-guarantees for security.

Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.   This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems.

While there is limited research exploring possible containment strategies, such work is bounded by the underlying field the strategies draw upon. Accordingly, we set out to construct an ontology to describe necessary elements in any future containment technology. Using existing academic literature, we developed a single domain ontology containing five levels, 32 codes, and 32 associated descriptors. Further, we constructed ontology diagrams to demonstrate intended relationships. We then identified humans, AGI, and the cyber world as novel agent objects necessary for future containment activities.

We address I) by learning a causal Bayesian network from simulation data. Concerning II), we propose a novel method that enables robots to generate contrastive explanations upon task failures. The explanation is based on setting the failure state in contrast with the closest state that would have allowed for successful execution, which is found through breadth-first search and is based on success predictions from the learned causal model. We assess the sim2real transferability of the causal model on a cube stacking scenario. Based on real-world experiments with two differently embodied robots, we achieve a sim2real accuracy of 70% without any adaptation or retraining.

For humans, rapid learning from examples can benefit from explanations that connect examples to task principles. We therefore investigate whether explanations of few-shot examples can allow language models to adapt more effectively. We annotate a set of 40 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench with explanations of answers to a small subset of questions, as well as a variety of matched control explanations. We evaluate the effects of various zero-shot and few-shot prompts that include different types of explanations, instructions, and controls on the performance of a range of large language models. We analyze these results using statistical multilevel modeling techniques that account for the nested dependencies among conditions, tasks, prompts, and models. We find that explanations of examples can improve performance. Adding untuned explanations to a few-shot prompt offers a modest improvement in performance; about 1\/3 the effect size of adding few-shot examples, but twice the effect size of task instructions. We then show that explanations tuned for performance on a small validation set offer substantially larger benefits; building a prompt by selecting examples and explanations together substantially improves performance over selecting examples alone. Hand-tuning explanations can substantially improve performance on challenging tasks. Furthermore, even untuned explanations outperform carefully matched controls, suggesting that the benefits are due to the link between an example and its explanation, rather than lower-level features of the language used. However, only large models can benefit from explanations. In summary, explanations can support the in-context learning abilities of large language models on challenging tasks."},{"id":"1705.09970v2","title":"Probabilistic Program Abstractions","authors":"Steven Holtzen, Todd Millstein, Guy Van den Broeck","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1705.09970v2","content":"Abstraction is a fundamental tool for reasoning about complex systems. Program abstraction has been utilized to great effect for analyzing deterministic programs. At the heart of program abstraction is the relationship between a concrete program, which is difficult to analyze, and an abstract program, which is more tractable. Program abstractions, however, are typically not probabilistic. We generalize non-deterministic program abstractions to probabilistic program abstractions by explicitly quantifying the non-deterministic choices. Our framework upgrades key definitions and properties of abstractions to the probabilistic context.

These quality supervisions are usually infeasible or prohibitively expensive to obtain in practice. We aim for a unified framework that leverages the available cheap weak supervisions to perform policy learning efficiently. To handle this problem, we treat the \"weak supervision\" as imperfect information coming from a peer agent, and evaluate the learning agent's policy based on a \"correlated agreement\" with the peer agent's policy (instead of simple agreements). Our approach explicitly punishes a policy for overfitting to the weak supervision. In addition to theoretical guarantees, extensive evaluations on tasks including RL with noisy rewards, BC with weak demonstrations, and standard policy co-training show that our method leads to substantial performance improvements, especially when the complexity or the noise of the learning environments is high."},{"id":"2007.10866v1","title":"IITK-RSA at SemEval-2020 Task 5: Detecting Counterfactuals","authors":"Anirudh Anil Ojha, Rohin Garg, Shashank Gupta, Ashutosh Modi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2007.10866v1","content":"This paper describes our efforts in tackling Task 5 of SemEval-2020.

Probability matching, as this strategy is called, is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL). However, MaxEnt RL does not optimize expected utility. In this paper, we formally show that MaxEnt RL does optimally solve certain classes of control problems with variability in the reward function. In particular, we show (1) that MaxEnt RL can be used to solve a certain class of POMDPs, and (2) that MaxEnt RL is equivalent to a two-player game where an adversary chooses the reward function. These results suggest a deeper connection between MaxEnt RL, robust control, and POMDPs, and provide insight for the types of problems for which we might expect MaxEnt RL to produce effective solutions. Specifically, our results suggest that domains with uncertainty in the task goal may be especially well-suited for MaxEnt RL methods."},{"id":"1805.08355v1","title":"Opening the black box of deep learning","authors":"Dian Lei, Xiaoxiao Chen, Jianfei Zhao","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1805.08355v1","content":"The great success of deep learning shows that its technology contains profound truth, and understanding its internal mechanism not only has important implications for the development of its technology and effective application in various fields, but also provides meaningful insights into the understanding of human brain mechanism.

To guard AI from adversaries, paper explores combination of 3 strategies:   1. Introduce randomness at inference time to hide the representation learning from adversaries.   2. Detect presence of adversaries by analyzing the sequence of inferences.   3. Exploit visual similarity.   To realize these strategies, this paper designs a novel architecture, Dynamic Neural Defense, DND. This defense has 3 deep learning architectural features:   1. By hiding the way a neural network learns from exploratory attacks using a random computation graph, DND evades attack.   2. By analyzing input sequence to cloud AI inference engine with LSTM, DND detects attack sequence.   3. By inferring with visual similar inputs generated by VAE, any AI defended by DND approach does not succumb to hackers.

This fear is compounded by the inability to point to a trustworthy source of AI, however even the term \"trustworthy AI\" itself is troublesome. Some consider trustworthy AI to be that which complies with relevant laws, while others point to the requirement to comply with ethics and standards (whether in addition to or in isolation of the law).

A research framework and three novel indicators, Average Time Interval (ATI), Innovation Speed (IS) and Update Speed (US), are proposed to measure the pace of innovations in the field of AI. The results show that: (1) in 2019, more than 3 AI preprints were submitted to arXiv per hour, over 148 times faster than in 1994. Furthermore, there was one deep learning-related preprint submitted to arXiv every 0.87 hours in 2019, over 1,064 times faster than in 1994. (2) For AI players, 5.26 new researchers entered into the field of AI each hour in 2019, more than 175 times faster than in the 1990s. (3) As for AI updates (trial and error), one updated AI preprint was submitted to arXiv every 41 days, with around 33% of AI preprints having been updated at least twice in 2019. In addition, as reported in 2019, it took, on average, only around 0.2 year for AI preprints to receive their first citations, which is 5 times faster than 2000-2007.

Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions."},{"id":"2108.10451v1","title":"Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications","authors":"Wenjie Ruan, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2108.10451v1","content":"This tutorial aims to introduce the fundamentals of adversarial robustness of deep learning, presenting a well-structured review of up-to-date techniques to assess the vulnerability of various types of deep learning models to adversarial examples.

We reveal corresponding patterns in the emergence of AI - globally and in the context of specific geographies of the US, Japan, South Korea, and China. We argue that AI emergence is associated with increasing related variety due to knowledge commonalities as well as increasing complexity. We use patent-based indicators for the period between 1974-2018 to analyse the evolution of AI's global technological space, to identify its technological core as well as changes to its overall relatedness and knowledge complexity. At the national level, we also measure countries' overall specialisations against AI-specific ones. At the global level, we find increasing overall relatedness and complexity of AI. However, for the technological core of AI, which has been stable over time, we find decreasing related variety and increasing complexity. This evidence points out that AI innovations related to core technologies are becoming increasingly distinct from each other. At the country level, we find that the US and Japan have been increasing the overall relatedness of their innovations. The opposite is the case for China and South Korea, which we associate with the fact that these countries are overall less technologically developed than the US and Japan. Finally, we observe a stable increasing overall complexity for all countries apart from China, which we explain by the focus of this country in technologies not strongly linked to AI."},{"id":"2203.14924v1","title":"Sandboxing (AI-based) Unverified Controllers in Stochastic Games: An Abstraction-based Approach with Safe-visor Architecture","authors":"Bingzhuo Zhong, Hongpeng Cao, Majid Zamani, Marco Caccamo","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2203.14924v1","content":"In this paper, we propose a construction scheme for a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing unverified controllers, e.g., artificial intelligence-based (a.k.a.

Moreover, by leveraging an ($\\epsilon,\\delta$)-approximate probabilistic relation between the original game and its finite abstraction, we provide a formal safety guarantee with respect to safety specifications modeled by deterministic finite automata (DFA), while the functionality of the unverified controllers is still exploited.

To cope with this difficulty, we propose in this work a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing unverified controllers in CPSs operating in noisy environments (a.k.a. stochastic CPSs). The proposed architecture contains a history-based supervisor, which checks inputs from the unverified controller and makes a compromise between functionality and safety of the system, and a safety advisor that provides fallback when the unverified controller endangers the safety of the system. Both the history-based supervisor and the safety advisor are designed based on an approximate probabilistic relation between the original system and its finite abstraction. By employing this architecture, we provide formal probabilistic guarantees on preserving the safety specifications expressed by accepting languages of deterministic finite automata (DFA).

To soften the excitation requirements, model-based reinforcement learning methods that rely on exact model knowledge have also been integrated with the barrier transformation framework. The objective of this paper is to develop safe reinforcement learning method for deterministic nonlinear systems, with parametric uncertainties in the model, to learn approximate constrained optimal policies without relying on stringent excitation conditions.

But what should we assume when it is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is acting on our behalf? Early examples of AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana already serve as a key interface between consumers and information on the web, and users routinely rely upon AI-driven systems like these to take automated actions or provide information. Superficially, such systems may appear to be acting according to user interests. However, many AI systems are designed with embedded conflicts of interests, acting in ways that subtly benefit their creators (or funders) at the expense of users. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce the concept of AI loyalty. AI systems are loyal to the degree that they are designed to minimize, and make transparent, conflicts of interest, and to act in ways that prioritize the interests of users. Properly designed, such systems could have considerable functional and competitive - not to mention ethical - advantages relative to those that do not. Loyal AI products hold an obvious appeal for the end-user and could serve to promote the alignment of the long-term interests of AI developers and customers. To this end, we suggest criteria for assessing whether an AI system is sufficiently transparent about conflicts of interest, and acting in a manner that is loyal to the user, and argue that AI loyalty should be considered during the technological design process alongside other important values in AI ethics such as fairness, accountability privacy, and equity. We discuss a range of mechanisms, from pure market forces to strong regulatory frameworks, that could support incorporation of AI loyalty into a variety of future AI systems."},{"id":"1711.11068v2","title":"Happiness Pursuit: Personality Learning in a Society of Agents","authors":"Rafa\u0142 Muszy\u0144ski, Jun Wang","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1711.11068v2","content":"Modeling personality is a challenging problem with applications spanning computer games, virtual assistants, online shopping and education.

As a result, we obtain 4 agents, each with its own personality. Then, we define happiness of an agent, which can be seen as a measure of alignment with agent's objective function, and study it when agents play both against hand-coded AI, and against each other. We find that the agents that achieve higher happiness during testing against hand-coded AI, have lower happiness when competing against each other. This suggests that higher happiness in testing is a sign of overfitting in learning to interact with hand-coded AI, and leads to worse performance against agents with different personalities."},{"id":"2002.05672v2","title":"Steps Towards Value-Aligned Systems","authors":"Osonde A.

In addition, the late Steven Hawking warned that the rise of robots may be disastrous for mankind. A major concern is that even benevolent superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) may become seriously harmful if its given goals are not exactly aligned with ours, or if we cannot specify precisely its objective function. Metaphorically, this is compared to king Midas in Greek mythology, who expressed the wish that everything he touched should turn to gold, but obviously this wish was not specified precisely enough. In our view, this sounds like requirements problems and the challenge of their precise formulation. (To our best knowledge, this has not been pointed out yet.) As usual in requirements engineering (RE), ambiguity or incompleteness may cause problems. In addition, the overall issue calls for a major RE endeavor, figuring out the wishes and the needs with regard to a superintelligence, which will in our opinion most likely be a very complex software-intensive system based on AI.

This problem is exacerbated by the \"opaque\" nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety."},{"id":"1907.04446v1","title":"Let's Keep It Safe: Designing User Interfaces that Allow Everyone to Contribute to AI Safety","authors":"Travis Mandel, Jahnu Best, Randall H.

In this paper, we study how to design user interfaces that make this process more effective and accessible, allowing people with a diversity of backgrounds and levels of expertise to contribute to this task. We first present a task design in which workers evaluate the safety of individual state-action pairs, and propose several variants of this task with improved task design and filtering mechanisms. Although this first design is easy to understand, it scales poorly to large state spaces. Therefore, we develop a new user interface that allows workers to write constraint rules without any programming. Despite its simplicity, we show that our rule construction interface retains full expressiveness. We present experiments utilizing crowdworkers to help address an important real-world AI safety problem in the domain of education.

The latter suggests that to infer what someone means, an agent constructs a rationale for the observed behaviour of others. Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason.

A measure for partial progress in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby compressing the data increasingly at every iteration.   Abstract Based on that fundamental ability, a grounded reasoning system is proposed. It is argued how grounding and flexible feature bases made of hypotheses allow for resourceful thinking. While the simulation of representation contents on the mental stage accounts for much of the power of propositional logic, compression leads to simple sets of hypotheses that allow the detection and verification of universally quantified statements.

AI model governance frequently involves complex review flows and relies heavily on manual steps. As a result, it faces serious challenges in effectiveness, cost, complexity, and speed. Furthermore, the unprecedented rate of growth in the AI model complexity raises questions on the sustainability of the current practices.

However, despite the success of AI in different areas, the problem of designing AI systems that can truly mimic human cognitive capabilities such as artificial general intelligence, remains largely open. Consequently, many emerging cross-device AI applications will require a transition from traditional centralized learning systems towards large-scale distributed AI systems that can collaboratively perform multiple complex learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel design philosophy called democratized learning (Dem-AI) whose goal is to build large-scale distributed learning systems that rely on the self-organization of distributed learning agents that are well-connected, but limited in learning capabilities. Correspondingly, inspired by the societal groups of humans, the specialized groups of learning agents in the proposed Dem-AI system are self-organized in a hierarchical structure to collectively perform learning tasks more efficiently. As such, the Dem-AI learning system can evolve and regulate itself based on the underlying duality of two processes which we call specialized and generalized processes. In this regard, we present a reference design as a guideline to realize future Dem-AI systems, inspired by various interdisciplinary fields. Accordingly, we introduce four underlying mechanisms in the design such as plasticity-stability transition mechanism, self-organizing hierarchical structuring, specialized learning, and generalization. Finally, we establish possible extensions and new challenges for the existing learning approaches to provide better scalable, flexible, and more powerful learning systems with the new setting of Dem-AI."},{"id":"2007.07710v1","title":"Human $\\neq$ AGI","authors":"Roman V.

Machine common sense has long been a critical-but-missing component of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new AI capabilities, but in all of these applications, machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized. Developers must carefully train or program systems for every situation. General commonsense reasoning remains elusive. The absence of common sense prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world, behaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating naturally with people, and learning from new experiences. Its absence is perhaps the most significant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today and the more general, human-like AI systems we would like to build in the future. Machine common sense remains a broad, potentially unbounded problem in AI. There are a wide range of strategies that could be employed to make progress on this difficult challenge. This paper discusses two diverse strategies for focusing development on two different machine commonsense services: (1) a service that learns from experience, like a child, to construct computational models that mimic the core domains of child cognition for objects (intuitive physics), agents (intentional actors), and places (spatial navigation); and (2) service that learns from reading the Web, like a research librarian, to construct a commonsense knowledge repository capable of answering natural language and image-based questions about commonsense phenomena."},{"id":"2001.11821v1","title":"Adversarial vs behavioural-based defensive AI with joint, continual and active learning: automated evaluation of robustness to deception, poisoning and concept drift","authors":"Alexandre Dey, Marc Velay, Jean-Philippe Fauvelle, Sylvain Navers","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2001.11821v1","content":"Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought new capabilities to behavioural analysis (UEBA) for cyber-security consisting in the detection of hostile action based on the unusual nature of events observed on the Information System.In our previous work (presented at C\\&ESAR 2018 and FIC 2019), we have associated deep neural networks auto-encoders for anomaly detection and graph-based events correlation to address major limitations in UEBA systems. This resulted in reduced false positive and false negative rates, improved alert explainability, while maintaining real-time performances and scalability. However, we did not address the natural evolution of behaviours through time, also known as concept drift. To maintain effective detection capabilities, an anomaly-based detection system must be continually trained, which opens a door to an adversary that can conduct the so-called \"frog-boiling\" attack by progressively distilling unnoticed attack traces inside the behavioural models until the complete attack is considered normal. In this paper, we present a solution to effectively mitigate this attack by improving the detection process and efficiently leveraging human expertise. We also present preliminary work on adversarial AI conducting deception attack, which, in term, will be used to help assess and improve the defense system. These defensive and offensive AI implement joint, continual and active learning, in a step that is necessary in assessing, validating and certifying AI-based defensive solutions."},{"id":"1902.03689v2","title":"Safe Artificial General Intelligence via Distributed Ledger Technology","authors":"Kristen W.

Expert observers and artificial intelligence (AI) progression metrics indicate AI will exceed human intelligence within a few decades. Whether general AI that exceeds human capabilities (AGI) will be the single greatest boon in history or a disaster is unknown. No proofs exist that AGI will benefit humans or that AGI will not harm or eliminate humans.   Objective. I propose a set of logically distinct conceptual components that are necessary and sufficient to 1) ensure that most known AGI scenarios will not harm humanity and 2) robustly align AGI values and goals with human values.   Methods. By systematically addressing each pathway category to malevolent AI we can induce the methods\/axioms required to redress the category.   Results and Discussion. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain) is integral to this proposal, e.g. to reduce the probability of hacking, provide an audit trail to detect and correct errors or identify components causing vulnerability or failure and replace them or shut them down remotely and\/or automatically, and to separate and balance key AGI components via decentralized apps (dApps). Smart contracts based on DLT are necessary to address evolution of AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention.   The proposed axioms. 1) Access to technology by market license. 2) Transparent ethics embodied in DLT. 3) Morality encrypted via DLT. 4) Behavior control structure with values (ethics) at roots. 5) Individual bar-code identification of all critical components. 6) Configuration Item (from business continuity\/disaster recovery planning). 7) Identity verification secured via DLT. 8) Smart automated contracts based on DLT. 9) Decentralized applications - AI software code modules encrypted via DLT. 10) Audit trail of component usage stored via DLT. 11) Social ostracism (denial of societal resources) augmented by DLT petitions."},{"id":"1502.06512v1","title":"From Seed AI to Technological Singularity via Recursively Self-Improving Software","authors":"Roman V.

By integrating external information into the prediction process, we hope to reduce the need for ever-larger models and increase the democratization of AI systems. We find that the proposed external attention mechanism can significantly improve the performance of existing AI systems, allowing practitioners to easily customize foundation AI models to many diverse downstream applications. In particular, we focus on the task of Commonsense Reasoning, demonstrating that the proposed external attention mechanism can augment existing transformer models and significantly improve the model's reasoning capabilities.

A novel aspect of our design is to first view the structured data source as meaningful unstructured text, and then use the text to build an unsupervised neural network model using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique called word embedding. This model captures the hidden inter-\/intra-column relationships between database tokens of different types. For each database token, the model includes a vector that encodes contextual semantic relationships. We seamlessly integrate the word embedding model into existing SQL query infrastructure and use it to enable a new class of SQL-based analytics queries called cognitive intelligence (CI) queries. CI queries use the model vectors to enable complex queries such as semantic matching, inductive reasoning queries such as analogies, predictive queries using entities not present in a database, and, more generally, using knowledge from external sources. We demonstrate unique capabilities of Cognitive Databases using an Apache Spark based prototype to execute inductive reasoning CI queries over a multi-modal database containing text and images. We believe our first-of-a-kind system exemplifies using AI functionality to endow relational databases with capabilities that were previously very hard to realize in practice."},{"id":"2003.04707v1","title":"Neuro-symbolic Architectures for Context Understanding","authors":"Alessandro Oltramari, Jonathan Francis, Cory Henson, Kaixin Ma, Ruwan Wickramarachchi","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2003.04707v1","content":"Computational context understanding refers to an agent's ability to fuse disparate sources of information for decision-making and is, therefore, generally regarded as a prerequisite for sophisticated machine reasoning capabilities, such as in artificial intelligence (AI). Data-driven and knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid AI methodology as a general framework for combining the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, we inherit the concept of neuro-symbolism as a way of using knowledge-bases to guide the learning progress of deep neural networks. We further ground our discussion in two applications of neuro-symbolism and, in both cases, show that our systems maintain interpretability while achieving comparable performance, relative to the state-of-the-art."},{"id":"2004.09705v7","title":"Explainable Goal-Driven Agents and Robots -- A Comprehensive Review","authors":"Fatai Sado, Chu Kiong Loo, Wei Shiung Liew, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.09705v7","content":"Recent applications of autonomous agents and robots, such as self-driving cars, scenario-based trainers, exploration robots, and service robots have brought attention to crucial trust-related challenges associated with the current generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems based on the connectionist deep learning neural network approach lack capabilities of explaining their decisions and actions to others, despite their great successes. Without symbolic interpretation capabilities, they are black boxes, which renders their decisions or actions opaque, making it difficult to trust them in safety-critical applications. The recent stance on the explainability of AI systems has witnessed several approaches on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); however, most of the studies have focused on data-driven XAI systems applied in computational sciences. Studies addressing the increasingly pervasive goal-driven agents and robots are still missing. This paper reviews approaches on explainable goal-driven intelligent agents and robots, focusing on techniques for explaining and communicating agents perceptual functions (example, senses, and vision) and cognitive reasoning (example, beliefs, desires, intention, plans, and goals) with humans in the loop. The review highlights key strategies that emphasize transparency, understandability, and continual learning for explainability. Finally, the paper presents requirements for explainability and suggests a roadmap for the possible realization of effective goal-driven explainable agents and robots."},{"id":"1401.2121v1","title":"Emotional Responses in Artificial Agent-Based Systems: Reflexivity and Adaptation in Artificial Life","authors":"Carlos Pedro Gon\u00e7alves","url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1401.2121v1","content":"The current work addresses a virtual environment with self-replicating agents whose decisions are based on a form of \"somatic computation\" (soma - body) in which basic emotional responses, taken in parallelism to actual living organisms, are introduced as a way to provide the agents with greater reflexive abilities.
